# DELL Repository
Repository for ACL2024 Findings: [DELL: Generating Reactions and Explanations for LLM-Based Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10426)

All resources will be available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nPo6x3AY7Kt1Nb9DUUvBAhpMwad3zhvq?usp=sharing)

DELL mainly contains three core parts: (i) **D**iverse Reaction Generation; (ii) **E**xplainable Proxy Tasks; (iii) **LL**M-Based Expert Ensemble.  

You can follow the steps below to reproduce our results or train DELL on your dataset.
