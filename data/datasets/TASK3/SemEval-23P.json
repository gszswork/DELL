respect the vote and may just turn on it, but short of that I don't see any way the Conservatives would vote for it, and the majority is slender as it is, as the DUP is bitterly against it, and I can't see the Lib Dems voting for it, so it will only be if there are enough, what I can describe as remoaner MPs, that the deal won't be dead in the water.\nSputnik: What could be a solution to the political chaos if the Prime Minister's deal is not approved?\nMichael Swadling: The EU withdrawal act is in place; we'll leave and revert to WTO terms and that works, that's fine.\nI often use the example of an iPhone to people; that's a piece of technology which is manufactured in China, uses American technology and these are two countries we deal with on WTO terms, this isn't a fantasy, stuck in a port somewhere, there isn't a massive tariff, this is the world that really exists today.\nWhen we exit the EU on WTO terms; that will be fine for whatever trading we do with the EU, just as well

Johnson foolishly chose to go on BBC Radio 4 and trash Theresa May\u2019s premiership.\nHe informed interviewer Nick Robinson that Britain \u2018was in need of leadership\u2019 over Brexit.\nLethal words coming from a senior representative of Britain\u2019s closest ally and strategic partner \u2014 with whom we have enjoyed a so-called special relationship since the end of World War II.\nThis brutal attack by Donald Trump\u2019s top man in London threatens to seriously destabilise Theresa May on the eve of the Commons vote that will determine her \u2014 and Britain\u2019s \u2014 future.\nAll the more so since he held out the carrot of a \u2018quick, very massive bilateral trade deal\u2019 .\n.\n.\nif Mrs May\u2019s withdrawal agreement collapses.\nU.S. President Donald Trump waves next to U.S.\nAmbassador to U.K. Woody Johnson as he leaves the latter's residence in London\nNotorious\nFurthermore, Mr Johnson\u2019s intervention smashes all diplomatic protocol, and marks a grotesque abuse of his privileged position as U.S. ambassador to the Court of St James\u2019s.\nThe first rule of diplomacy is that an ambassador should never interfere with domestic politics.\nLeast of all should he undermine the position of the elected leader of the country where he resides, in effect as an invited guest.\nBy implication, Mr Johnson has lumped Theresa May with all the \u2018losers\u2019 whom his boss, President Trump, loves to mock in his notorious Twitter account.\nThere is no defence of Mr Johnson\u2019s conduct.\nAnd no explanation, except ignorance and a profound lack of judgement.\nMr Johnson, like so many modern American ambassadors, has no background in diplomacy.\nThis must explain why he has no idea how diplomacy works, and no conception of his duties and responsibilities.Theresa May is fighting the battle of her life as she tries to force her withdrawal plan through ParliamentIndeed, he effectively purchased his hugely important and privileged position as ambassador in Britain by fundraising for the Republican Party.\nHaving first acted as finance chief on Jeb Bush\u2019s doomed campaign to win the Republican nomination in 2016, he switched horses late in the day to become a major fundraiser for Trump in the final stages of his presidential run.\nThe switch paid off, and now we in Britain are blessed with the fruits of this cynical act of naked cronyism.\nBut then, Trump is notorious for appointing like-minded camp-followers such as Johnson to important ambassadorial jobs.\nTake Lana Marks, the President\u2019s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to South Africa.\nShe is a luxury handbag designer favoured by A-list celebrities.\nIn common with an embarrassing number of Trump\u2019s ambassadorial picks, Miss Marks is a member of Trump\u2019s exclusive Mar-a-Lago private members\u2019 resort in Florida, which has a $200,000 initiation fee.Her daughter got married there and features on the company website.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Robin Bernstein, is another Mar-a-Lago member, as well as a considerable donor to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\nEverything has its price in the squalid, amoral world of Donald Trump.\nAnd, in December, Trump\u2019s administration put forward as America\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations one Heather Nauert, a former Fox News television anchor with precious little hands-on experience of international diplomacy.\nAmbassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump\u2019s largesse to his pals\nAmbassador Woody Johnson is just one lucky beneficiary of Trump\u2019s largesse to his pals, even if the rest of us are losers.\nIn truth, his appointment is another very troubling sign of the betrayal in recent years of the best U.S. political traditions.\nSome of the greatest men in American history \u2014 including five future presidents \u2014 served as U.S. ambassador to London.\nWoody Johnson cannot be classed in their company.\nThis scion of the industrial company Johnson & Johnson \u2014 famous for making Band-Aid sticking plasters and shampoo \u2014 is not even second-division.\nOutcry\nTwelve years ago, his business dealings came under the microscope when questions were asked about his investment firm\u2019s involvement in tax avoidance schemes.\nJohnson said he had done nothing illegal, and had relied on advisers who told him such conduct was lawful.\nHowever, he settled with the U.S. tax authorities, paying 100 pc of the outstanding taxes and interest.\nIn Britain, such a record could have debarred Johnson from further involvement in public life.\nAnd the appointment of a character such as this to become British ambassador in Washington would have been greeted with a national outcry.\nBut then, it\u2019s quite impossible to imagine Sir Kim Darroch, our man in Washington, taking to the U.S. airwaves to denounce Trump in the way Woody Johnson did with Mrs May on New Year\u2019s Eve.\nOf course, Sir Kim would have had plenty of targets had he decided to pass judgement on the present incumbent of the White House.\nRobert Mueller\u2019s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election could lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President\nHe might shine a light on the deeply unjust treatment of black people and Muslims in Trump\u2019s America.\nOr on the progress of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into claims that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia before the 2016 presidential election, which may this year lead to the impeachment of the U.S. President.\nSquirming\nHe could ask why few senior members of the Trump administration seem able to hang on to their jobs for more than a matter of months before resigning in disgrace or quitting because they cannot work with the petulant President.\nAbove all, he could question the culture of cronyism which has enabled a political fund-raiser with no background in diplomacy to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain.\nI should point out that Mr Johnson did say that Britain\u2019s future was \u2018extremely positive, extremely bright\u2019.\nBut that does not excuse his slur on the Prime Minister.\nProfessional diplomats would have been squirming with embarrassment listening to his inept intervention in British politics, not least because they know Donald Trump only really knows and likes one British politician \u2014 Nigel Farage, the former leader of UKIP.\nI can\u2019t say for certain, but to me, it looks very much as if Trump gets his understanding of British politics from his friend Farage \u2014 and then passes on his wisdom to Woody Johnson.\nSo when Trump\u2019s crony Johnson turned up on the Today programme, he was really giving BBC listeners the world view of Farage.\nThe fact is that Johnson is out of his depth.\nLike his master, Donald Trump, he is becoming a national embarrassment to the U.S.\nIf the President won\u2019t rein him in \u2014 and I\u2019m not holding my breath \u2014 Britain\u2019s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt should haul this billionaire buffoon into the Foreign Office and read him the riot act.\nAnd if he continues to make political attacks on the Prime Minister, we should encourage him to take the next plane home.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition",

referendum stance'\nPressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.\nThe Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.\nMr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.\nBut a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.\nThere was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.\nThe research underlined the scale of the challenge Jeremy Corbyn faces from Labour members, with thousands considering quitting, nearly a quarter believing he is a Brexiteer, and nearly three quarters wanting a new referendum\nAttending a rail fare protest in central London today, Mr Corbyn again dodged as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists on Brexit\nThe work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.\nAlmost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.\nProfessor Tim Bale, of Queen Mary University London, said:'Our survey of Labour's grassroots clearly shows that Corbyn's apparent willingness to see the UK leave the EU - a stance he has recently reiterated - is seriously at odds with what the overwhelming majority of Labour's members want, and it doesn't reflect the views of most Labour voters either.''\nSpeaking at a rail fares protest in London, Mr Corbyn said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.\n'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.\n'This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed.\nIt's finally going to take place the second week of January.\nThat is not acceptable, this vote should have taken place more than a month ago.\nThis Government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May's deal.\n'Well both of those options are completely unacceptable.'\nThe work was carried out by YouGov for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project.\nSome 29 per cent of Labour's rank-and-file members said they oppose the stance that the party has taken on Brexit - and 56 per cent of those told researchers it has caused them to consider quitting.\nThat proportion would be equivalent to around 88,000 members, according to the project's analysis.\nIf there is another referendum - and a three-way question - some 88 per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, 3 per cent said they would leave with Theresa May's deal and 5 per cent would support leaving with no deal.\nIf the choice was between the Prime Minister's deal and leaving the EU without an agreement, some 27 per cent of Labour members said they would boycott the vote altogether, although 46 per cent said they would take Mrs May's deal.\nSome 89 per cent of Labour members - compared with 65 per cent of current Labour voters and only 45 per cent of all voters - are convinced that leaving the EU without a deal would cause economic damage in the medium to long-term.\nWhile just 35 per cent of the electorate as a whole believe that warnings of short-term disruption with potential problems for food and medicine supplies in a no-deal Brexit are realistic, that figure rises to 82 per cent of Labour members and 58 per cent of Labour voters.\nProf Bale said: 'Our survey suggests Labour's membership is overwhelmingly in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and badly wants a referendum to achieve that end.\nTheresa May (pictured delivering her New Year message) has been battling to get her Brexit deal through Parliament\n'It also suggests that Labour voters, while not as keen as the party's members on either count, are in the same camp.\n'Labour's grassroots clearly hate Brexit and, although many of them still love Corbyn, he might not be able to rely for much longer on their support for him trumping their opposition to leaving the EU.\n'As a result, our research is bound to increase the pressure on Labour's leader to get off the fence.'\nLabour MP Phil Wilson said: 'An overwhelming majority of Labour's voters, as well as its members, want the public to have the final say on Brexit and to stay in the European Union.\n'But the

with just a fortnight to go until a titanic Commons showdown on the PM's package.\nThe moment of truth was delayed last month when Mrs May conceded she was on track for a catastrophic defeat.\nThe

her New Year message (pictured) to urge her warring MPs to 'to put our differences aside and move forward together'\nSenior Tories Sir Bill Cash and Sir John Redwood are among those who have renewed their vow to oppose the Brexit deal\nSpeaking on a visit to Singapore, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that MPs could get 'absolutely everything we want' from Theresa May's Brexit deal.\n'We have a clear opportunity to leave the EU on 29th March,' he said.\n'It has the vast majority of things that people wanted, not absolutely everything.\n'The question is, can we turn this into something that gives us absolutely everything we wanted, and I believe we can.\n'There will be some tough negotiations to follow in the years ahead but I think getting this clearer language on the backstop will help to get it through Parliament.'\nMr Hunt said the PM was aiming to get concessions with 'legal force' that the Irish border backstop will only be temporary.\n'Theresa May has been very clear this isn't just about words but about text which has legal force,' he said.\n'She has also been very straightforward about this - the EU has agreed the backstop is temporary and that's a word they have agreed.\n'So what we're saying, very simply, is we're not asking for anything new but we are asking you to define what temporary means, so we can have confidence we're not going to be trapped in the customs union for ever against the wishes of the British people.'\nHe also said that a second referendum would be 'devastating' for the UK and the public's faith in politicians.\nLeading Cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also came out strongly for the package earlier this week.\nMrs May has been engaged in another frantic round of diplomacy as she tries to wring more concessions out of Brussels that could help her get the deal through Parliament.\nBut the EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.\nThe bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.\nHowever, senior Cabinet ministers are still privately convinced they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.\nUnder the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules.\nBrexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK's ability to do trade deals elsewhere.\nAnd the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK.\nCorbyn at odds with Labour activists over Brexit referendum Pressure is mounting on Jeremy Corbyn to back a second Brexit referendum after polling showed huge support among Labour members - and many ready to quit if he ignores them.\nThe Labour leader has been desperately resisting calls from within his own ranks to endorse another national vote, keeping the option open while insisting he prefers an election.\nBut a study of more than 1,000 Labour members found that 72 per cent want Mr Corbyn to throw his weight behind the policy.\nThere was also backing for a second referendum among wider Labour supporters, including 61 per cent of those who voted for the party at the 2017 election.\nThe work suggests that tens of thousands of Labour members could be prepared to quit the party over the leadership's approach to leaving the EU.\nAlmost a quarter (23 per cent) of Labour members put Mr Corbyn's failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.\nMr Corbyn again dodged today as he was challenged on why he was defying the views of Labour activists.\nSpeaking at a rail fares protest in London, he said: 'The issue of another referendum was of course one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.\n'We haven't yet had a vote and I think the Government really should be ashamed of itself.\nJacob Rees-Mogg, who heads the Eurosceptic ERG bloc of Tory MPs, said there was 'no sign at all' that the tide was turning.\n'I think it was based on the false premise that when at home in our constituencies people would tell us to back the deal,' he told MailOnline.\n'Instead, as far as I can tell, the message is stand firm against a bad deal.'\nSir Bill Cash said: 'My New Year's resolution - not to vote for the PM's Withdrawal Agreement this January.\n'Parliament exists to make our laws.\nThis Agreement lets the 27 EU countries impose laws on the UK as never before in our history- behind closed doors with no transcript and no UK at the meeting.'\nFormer Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood, who was knighted in the New Year honours sparking claims the government was trying to buy votes, made clear he had not changed his mind.\n'I see some are wrongly suggesting I am wobbling over voting against the Withdrawal Agreement,' he posted on Twitter.\n'They are mischief making & should read my blogs to understand why I oppose it.\nThey would then see I have several fundamental objections which cannot be fixed by tweaks or reassurances.'\nAnother senior Tory MP told MailOnline: 'Nothing has changed, as someone once said.'\nThey added: 'I think there was optimism over Christmas about people coming back in a better frame of mind, but it is wishful thinking...\n'I haven't head from anyone who has changed their minds.'\nMr Hunt denied that he wanted the UK to follow Singapore's social or political model post-Brexit but said he admired its economics.\nHe said: 'We do not want and do not seek to emulate the social or political model of Singapore.\n'I was health secretary for nearly six years, I am a passionate defender of a health service that is free at the point of use and, if you remember, I secured quite a lot of extra money for the health service during my tenure, so those things are very different.\n'But in terms of their economic model, there are some things we can learn.'\nMr Hunt praised Singapore's education investment and 'long-term approach' to economic development, particularly in fibre optics.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification",

Entangles Issue of Iranian Migrants Crossing English Channel\nThis morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nBrexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff\nBig upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians\nBrexit chaos continues as Britain heads for March 29 cliff\nMigrants from France arriving in Dover, England, this week (SPLASH)\nIt is hard to overestimate what a political disaster Brexit has been ever since the referendum passed on June 23, 2016.\nBritain, and to some extent the EU, have been almost completely deadlocked for two years.\nNow the committed date when Britain will leave the European Union is March 29, 2019.\nThe problem has always been the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and (Southern) Ireland (which will remain part of the EU).\nIreland and Northern Ireland have an extremely violent history described as \u201cThe Troubles,\u201d which were resolved by the Good Friday agreement in 1998 which, among other things, committed to remove any physical border between the two and allow free movement of goods and people.\nIt has been apparent since the beginning that no solution exists to meeting the objectives of the \u201cBrexiteers\u201d (the people who wanted Brexit) and maintaining a barrier-free border.\nSo that problem has always been insoluble and remains so today.\nSo there are four possibilities for what will happen on March 29:\n\u201cCrashing out of the EU\u201d \u2013 a no-deal Brexit.\nPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan.\nKilling the whole Brexit thing.\nKicking the can down the road by extending the March 29 date.\nThere is no U.K. majority for any of these options, but if there is no agreement, then the default will be a no-deal Brexit.\nIn my opinion, a way will be found to avoid this because it will be catastrophic for the economies of both the U.K. and E.U.\nI had thought that the Brexit decision was final once Britain submitted its two-year notice on March 29, 2017.\nHowever, in the last few months, an E.U.\ncourt has issued an opinion that Britain can reverse the Brexit decision, provided that it does so with finality and not just to start up a new two-year negotiation.\nSo that is an option.\nHowever, if Britain\u2019s government invokes it, it will invoke the howls of hell from people who say that the government is violating the will of the people.\nPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan, which I summarized in detail in October, is a transition plan that many consider to be the worst of all possible worlds.\nThe whole point of why the Brexiteers wanted Brexit was to get away from the E.U.\nregulations, E.U.\ntaxes, and the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\nIn the transition period, all of these will remain, with the additional restriction that the U.K. will have to obey all the regulations and pay all the money, but will have no say in changing them.\nThis plan is almost Karmic retribution for the idiocy of going ahead with Brexit in the first place.\nHowever, few people like Theresa May\u2019s plan and many pundits say that when it comes to a vote in Parliament on January 14, it is unlikely to pass.\nThat brings us to the last option: kicking the can down the road.\nIt is believed that if the U.K. requested it, then the E.U.\nwould agree to extend the March 29 date.\nThat would give time for more debate.\nSome people want to use that time to hold a new Brexit referendum.\nThe problem with that option is that even among the few people who want a new referendum, there is no agreement on what the question would be.\nWould it be the same two choices as the 2016 referendum?\nOr would it be the three choices, something like the first three options in the list above?\nSo really, no one knows what is going to happen out of this mess, but my bet would be that they will find some way to \u201cfudge,\u201d or to kick the can down the road.\nBloomberg (20-Dec) and Independent (Ireland) and Guardian (London, 17-Dec) and UK News (17-Dec)\nBig upsurge in migrants crossing English Channel by boat, especially Iranians\nA big increase in the number of migrants illegally crossing the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, England, is being blamed on the chaos surrounding Brexit.\nThere are reports that human traffickers are telling migrants that crossing from France to Britain will be much more difficult after March 29 because of Brexit and charging the migrants \u20ac15,000 or more to cross the Channel in a cheap dinghy.\nAt the same time, security has been toughened around ports and the Channel tunnel and authorities have been cracking down on migrants in northern France.\nHowever, there are still many more migrants who cross to Britain by stowing away on trucks that travel through the tunnel.\nThis is actually a fairly small number of migrants, but it has become a major political issue in Britain.\nIt is far smaller than the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Greece, where the E.U.\nborder force has been patrolling the waters.\nBut political pressure has forced Britain\u2019s Home Secretary to reassign to British patrol cutters from the Mediterranean to the English Channel.\nMany of the migrants are from Iran.\nThis is believed to be the result of a policy that Serbia implemented between August and October 2017, offering visa-free travel to people from Iran for 30 days.\nMore than 40,000 Iranians visited Serbia, but it is believed as many as 12,000 did not return home after 30 days, but instead moved through the Schengen Zone to western Europe and, in particular, to Calais, France, hoping to reach Britain.\nThe trip across the English Channel is 21 miles, but cross-currents can make the trip much longer.\nThe trip can be particularly dangerous due to high seas and busy shipping lanes.\nIf a British patrol boat captures the migrants in British waters, then they are required to take them to Britain; otherwise, the patrol boat can return them to France.\nWhen a migrant reaches Britain, he is evaluated for eligibility for asylum.\nIranians are likely to be granted asylum because of Iran\u2019s human rights record.\nFor that reason, migrants from Iraq or Syria often claim to be from Iran.\nDaily Mail and Guardian (London) and Deutsche Welle\nRelated Articles:\nKEYS: Generational Dynamics, Britain, Brexit, Theresa May,

are being trained up for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of violence stemming from a no-deal Brexit.\nChiefs from the Police Service of Northern Ireland had asked for the reinforcements to handle any problems that may arise from a hard border.\nIt is thought large numbers of officers from Britain on the streets could anger Irish republicans.\nBut additional officers are thought to be

regular duties, according to The Guardian.\nNews of the continued no-deal Brexit preparations came on another difficult day for Theresa May.\nWhat is the Irish border backstop and why do Tory MPs hate it?\nThe so-called Irish border backstop is one of the most controversial parts of the PM's Brexit deal.\nThis is what it means: What is the backstop?\nThe backstop was invented to meet promises to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland even if there is no comprehensive UK-EU trade deal.\nThe divorce deal says it will kick in automatically at the end of the Brexit transition if that deal is not in place.If effectively keeps the UK in a customs union with the EU and Northern Ireland in both the customs union and single market..\nThis means many EU laws will keep being imposed on the UK and there can be no new trade deals.\nIt also means regulatory checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea.\nWhy have Ireland and the EU demanded it?\nBecause Britain demanded to leave the EU customs union and single market, the EU said it needed guarantees people and goods circulating inside met EU rules.\nThis is covered by the Brexit transition, which effectively maintains current rules, and can in theory be done in the comprehensive EU-UK trade deal.\nBut the EU said there had to be a backstop to cover what happens in any gap between transition and final deal.\nWhy do critics hate it?\nBecause Britain cannot decide when to leave the backstop.\nGetting out - even if there is a trade deal - can only happen if both sides agree people and goods can freely cross the border.\nBrexiteers fear the EU will unreasonably demand the backstop continues so EU law continues to apply in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland MPs also hate the regulatory border in the Irish Sea, insisting it unreasonably carves up the United Kingdom..\nWhat concessions did Britain get in negotiating it?\nDuring the negotiations, Britain persuaded Brussels the backstop should apply to the whole UK and not just Northern Ireland.\nImportantly, this prevents a customs border down the Irish Sea - even if some goods still need to be checked.\nThe Government said this means Britain gets many of the benefits of EU membership after transition without all of the commitments - meaning Brussels will be eager to end the backstop.\nIt also got promises the EU will act in 'good faith' during the future trade talks and use its 'best endeavours' to finalise a deal - promises it says can be enforced in court.\nWhat did the legal advice say about it?\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox said even with the EU promises, if a trade deal cannot be reached the backstop could last forever.\nThis would leave Britain stuck in a Brexit limbo, living under EU rules it had no say in writing and no way to unilaterally end it.\nThe DUP on whom the Tories rely for a Commons majority, insisted their objections to Irish border backstop arrangements remained, while the EU closed ranks in the face of demands for new concessions.\nAfter a meeting with the Prime Minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said:'The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government's commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.''\nMr Dodds again attacked the proposed Irish border backstop, which would see the UK remain under EU customs rules if no wider trade deal was agreed by the end of a withdrawal transition period, as unnecessary.\nHowever, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would not accept any changes to the deal that would make the backstop inoperable.\nMr Varadkar said he had spoken to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by telephone on Thursday and the two leaders agreed to 'stand by' the Brexit deal.\nHe said: 'We're happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.'\nMr Varadkar said the conversation, which lasted about 40 minutes, focused on securing the ratification of the deal.\nThe remarks are a blow to the Prime Minister, who is trying to get concessions on the Irish backstop plans in the hope it will convince MPs to vote her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament later this month.\nMr Varadkar's comments came as the EU confirmed 'no further meetings are foreseen' with the UK on updating Mrs May's Brexit deal because negotiations have concluded.\nA spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the leaders of the remaining 27 countries 'have been very clear' that what is on the table 'will not be renegotiated'.\nAt a press conference in Brussels, Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held before the Commons has its say on the deal in the week of January 14.\nShe said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.\n'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'\nMs Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: 'For now, no further meetings are foreseen between the Commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'\nShe said Mr Juncker is 'always willing to listen to Mrs May's views on the backstop', but when asked what else he can do to help her deal get through Parliament, she rebuffed any chance of altering the backstop as it currently stands.\nAnd Mrs May's deal drew criticism from Tory former minister Ben Gummer, who co-authored the Conservative manifesto at the last election.\nMr Gummer, who lost his Ipswich seat at the 2017 election, said it would leave the country poorer for generations.\nHe told the BBC: 'I think it is probably unique in modern parliamentary history, because Members of Parliament are being asked to walk through the division lobbies to make the country, and their constituents, permanently poorer and less secure.\n'Not just in one generation, but in two or three.'\nMr Gummer said if Parliament failed to find a route through the Brexit situation, a new referendum should be held.\nThe comments came as Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the consequences of a no-deal Brexit would be 'considerable' in the agricultural sector.\nTwo girls walk past a burning car left

the country's agriculture minister warned today.\nMichael Creed said it would take 'mega money' to ease the impact of a no-deal Brexit - with beef, dairy and fishing among the most vulnerable sectors.\nThe warning came as Brussels again appeared to dismiss Theresa May's plea for fresh concessions to help her get the Brexit package through the Commons later this month.\nAn EU commission spokeswoman also said there were no plans for any further negotiations with the UK - despite the PM insisting talks are ongoing.\nThe latest standoff has sent the chances of a no-deal Brexit spiralling, as Mrs May looks down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14.\nKilling off the plan could throw the government into chaos, with the UK set to crash out of the bloc by default at the end of March unless politicians can agree another course.\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar is seen as having been one of the main obstacles to sealing a deal, after he insisted on a 'backstop' to guarantee no hard border with Northern Ireland.\nThe DUP has condemned the proposals because they risk splitting the UK, while Brexiteers say it will prevent the country striking trade deals elsewhere.\nHowever, the intervention by Mr Creed today underlines the threat of disruption Ireland faces if there is no Brexit deal.\nTheresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) is looking down the barrel of near-certain defeat in the Parliamentary showdown due in the week beginning January 14\nSpeaking about the need for support from the EU in the event of no deal, he told the Irish Independent: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.\n'Between the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'\nNearly 80 per cent of Irish exporters deliver products to Britain, according to 2016 government figures.\nThe country is also considered a vital 'land bridge' to the European continent\n'There is a high level of awareness of Ireland's unique exposure to the UK food market,' Mr Creed said.\n'I think nobody wants to talk about it right now because there is still a hope and expectation that a level of sanity will prevail.'\nBut, he added: 'In racing parlance the odds are slashed on a hard Brexit.\nIf Britain crashes out of the European Union on March 29, Creed said he hoped an EU grant would be approved at a Luxembourg summit of EU farming ministers in April.\nDublin outlined its no deal contingency plans before the Christmas break.\nThey include schemes for port overhauls, a fund for Brexit-specific tax staff and talks to preserve the island's integrated electricity network.\nUp to 45 pieces of emergency legislation would be required.\nAt a press conference in Brussels this morning Mina Andreeva, deputy chief spokeswoman for the European Commission, was asked what talks would be held with the UK before the Commons vote.\nShe said: 'We have said many times the deal that is on the table is the best and only deal possible.\n'And the EU27 leaders confirmed on December 13 in their conclusions that it will not be renegotiated.'\nMs Andreeva said the EU side have 'started the ratification process' on the terms in the Withdrawal Agreement, and confirmed Brussels is ready to start preparations on a new trade deal 'immediately after the signature' on the deal from the UK Government.\nShe added: 'For now no further meetings are foreseen between the commission's negotiators and the UK negotiators as the negotiations have indeed been concluded.'\n", ["Repetition",

he could have diverted more money to the Met to put extra bobbies on the beat.\nSome of this largesse was frittered away turning the London Eye into a blue and yellow EU flag, as part of a cynical, self-serving propaganda stunt aimed at bolstering the Stop Brexit campaign and burnishing the image of the Mayor himself.\nI wonder if Tudor Simionov was aware of Khan\u2019s New Year message boasting that London would remain open after Brexit, broadcast in a number of foreign languages, including Romanian.\nNo one has ever suggested London won\u2019t stay open when we leave the EU.\nThis was pure political posturing, at our expense.\nThe majority of Londoners may have backed Remain, but the really significant statistic is that more voted Leave (1.5 million) than voted for Khan (1.3 million).\nWhat\u2019s most likely to deter immigrants from coming here is not Khan slandering Leave voters as knuckle-scraping, racist bigots, but the news that someone can be stabbed to death on one of London\u2019s busiest, best-known and most upmarket streets within two months of arriving in the country seeking a better future.\nUnder Khan, there has been an explosion of violent crime.\nIn addition to the New Year stabbings, a woman was shot in a nightclub in Hackney on the same night.\nA day earlier, 39 people were arrested in Hammersmith on suspicion of attempted murder after another stabbing at a party.\nWe are all now familiar with the fact that last year London\u2019s murder rate overtook New York.\nThere were 134 violent deaths in 2018, an increase of 15 per cent.\nAnd if that chilling reality doesn\u2019t put people off moving here from overseas, then perhaps they may be dissuaded by the paralysis on London\u2019s roads and the exorbitant cost of housing \u2014 two key problems Khan has exacerbated, rather than solved\nHe promised 80,000 new homes a year, yet in the 12 months to last April built just over 5,300.\nLondon\u2019s economy may be steaming ahead (no

convinced a no-deal Brexit would be better than Mrs May's plan.\nMore than half of members polled (57 per cent) said their first preference was to leave with no deal.\nDublin 'mega-money' warning over Brexit Ireland last night warned Brussels it will demand 'mega-money' in the form of aid if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.\nIreland's agriculture minister said a no-deal Brexit would have a crippling effect on his country's agriculture sector \u2013 which depends heavily on trade with the UK.\nHe said his country's farmers had been hit by the devaluation of sterling since Brexit, but said: 'A hard Brexit would make that look like a teddy bears' picnic.'\nHe added: 'You're looking at hundreds of millions here.\nBetween the beef industry and the fishing industry we're talking mega-money.'\nEU diplomats fear this could spark claims by other countries likely to be hit by a no-deal Brexit.\nThe figure is more than double the 25 per cent of the population as a whole who would plump for no deal.\nThe hardline stance of most Tory members will dismay Mrs May's allies, who had hoped that activists would use the Christmas break to pressure their rebellious MPs to fall into line.\nBut having the support of Tory voters \u2013 who will decide the party's electoral fate \u2013 does provide a crumb of comfort.\nDowning Street will also be encouraged by a finding that 40 per cent of members said their second preference was to leave with Mrs May's deal, suggesting they could live with the compromise.\nAnd the study found that if Mrs May's deal was pitted directly against the option of Remain in a second referendum, Tory members would grudgingly back her plan by 57 per cent to 18.\nThe PM was forced to postpone a vote on her Brexit deal last month after Tory whips warned she faced a crushing defeat, with more than 100 of her own MPs threatening to vote against.\nThe crunch vote is now due to be held on or around January 15.\nBut there are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart.\nA senior source acknowledged that, with just ten days to go before the vote, the situation was 'still looking pretty challenging'.\nProfessor Bale said the findings indicated that activists were 'if anything, even less impressed than MPs' with her deal.\nFormer leader Iain Duncan Smith said the new polling made it clear Mrs May's deal was unacceptable to the party.\nThere are few signs that Eurosceptic Tories are having a change of heart, according to a new survey\n'If No 10 thought the Christmas and New Year break would make a difference then they have been proved wrong,' he said.\n'The pressure coming from members is to kill off this deal, not support it.'\nWith 83 per cent of members opposed to a second referendum, it suggests any future leadership candidate proposing one would lose.\nThe research was produced by the Party Members Project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.\n",

with European leaders over a divorce deal.\nLast month, May pulled a vote on the brokered withdrawal agreement, settled on in November after more than a year of back-and-forth negotiations between London and Brussels, acknowledging it would have been roundly rejected by the UK's lower chamber House of Commons.\nShe later announced the vote would go forward in the week beginning January 14.\n181214120018250\nBut parliamentary opposition to her deal remains fierce, with the main sticking point being the safety net \"backstop\" measure - which would guarantee no hard border is erected on the island of Ireland in the event that post-Brexit trade negotiations between the UK and the bloc prove unsuccessful.\nCritics of the backstop, which proposes that the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, remain in a customs union with the EU \"unless and until\" the bloc agrees there is no prospect of a return to a hard border, argue it could tie the UK into the EU's orbit indefinitely.\nIn an effort to assuage MPs concerns, May has lobbied her European counterparts and officials in Brussels to make concessions on the clause.\nThe EU, for its part, has insisted that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated but has made clear the backstop is meant only as a temporary measure of last resort.\nDUP digs its heels in\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party

on Sunday.\n\"The coming days will show if this government is made of the right stuff,\" he added.\nThe main opposition Labour Party has also pledged to vote down May's deal in parliament and threatened to initiate a no-confidence vote in her leadership should MPs refuse to back her plan.\n181208084355355\nAnalysts said May's comments to the BBC did little to conceal the fact the British leader has no \"gamechanger\" amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement capable of swinging the parliamentary arithmetic in her favour.\n\"We are pretty much where we were before Christmas, with the proviso that there's less time left.\nI don't see how the deal passes at the moment ... the interesting thing will be how much it loses by at the first attempt,\" Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King's College London, told Al Jazeera.\n\"There are some MPs who are looking for an excuse to back the deal and so, something tokenistic and declaratory from the EU on the backstop clause would work for them, but I don't understand how that would work for the DUP, and that's where the action is,\" he added.\n\"Peeling off five of 10 Conservative Party MPs

which began as a nebulous economic protest in France, has found a new life with far-right groups abroad.\nIn Canada, the movement has spawned regular protests with a strong anti-immigrant message.\nIn the U.K., pro-Brexit factions have worn yellow vests to harass their rivals.\nParticipants in the Canadian and British demonstrations have also mixed the French movement with an unhinged American conspiracy theory.\nThe result is an international movement riddled with extremists, all feeding off the more popular French protests.\nThe original French Yellow Vest (\u201cGilets Jaunes\u201d) demonstrations were not without their own far-right element.\nSome of the movement\u2019s earliest marches saw reports of racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia, the New Republic reported.\nA notorious anti-Semite was photographed as the face of the protests before journalists later recognized him.\nA December poll found the movement had the highest favorability ratings with supporters of the far-right politician Marine Le Pen.\nBut the movement had a broader appeal.\nThe protests kicked off in November, sparked by a bundle of populist issues, including a new fuel tax and rising income inequality.\nLiberal, leftist, and anarchist elements joined the protests.\nA popular meme about the protests illustrated the movement\u2019s allure to the political right and left, and to authoritarians and anarchists, alike.\nThis omnidirectional anger at French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist policies earned the Yellow Vest movement favorable polling in France\u2014and admiration abroad.\nFootage of the protests became popular on far-right and conspiracy Facebook pages in the U.S., where Americans highlighted some protesters\u2019 anti-immigrant sentiments and promoted a hoax about Parisians chanting \u201cwe want Trump.\u201d (President Donald Trump later repeated the false claim on Twitter.)\nPro-Yellow Vest memes are popular on Reddit\u2019s biggest Trump page, r/the_donald.\nIn the U.K. and Canada, in particular, those far-right elements have taken their Yellow Vest admiration offline and onto the streets.\nIn London and Manchester this weekend,

a QAnon slogan on it, the BBC\u2019s Mike Wendling reported.\nQAnon is an American conspiracy theory that falsely claims Trump\u2019s rivals are involved in bizarre crimes, namely child sex-trafficking and cannibalism.\nDespite the theory\u2019s obvious falsehoods, failed predictions, and origins in the U.S., it has attracted international fans who believe QAnon\u2019s claims about global crime rings and imminent mass arrests.\nThe theory has a growing Canadian fanbase, The Daily Beast previously reported, and Canadian Yellow Vest protesters have carried QAnon signs since at least mid-December.\nAlthough QAnon is led by an anonymous forum user who claims to be a Trump insider, its followers have increasingly expanded on the conspiracy theory, making it difficult for even its original author to control.\n\u201cI really feel like we're heading for a Q movement where Q isn't necessary,\u201d Mike Rothschild, a writer documenting QAnon\u2019s evolution remarked on Twitter this weekend.\nThat leaderless conspiracy movement could end up looking a lot like elements of the U.K. and Canadian Yellow Vest movements: nebulous in structure, but undeniably far-right.\nA Friday

been criticized by both sides of the debate for her handling of the implementation of the 2016 referendum, with Remain supporters accusing her of presiding over chaos, with pro-Brexit factions in her own Conservative Party claiming that she has kowtowed to Brussels and that her deal does not actually lead to Brexit being delivered.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be voting against the withdrawal agreement because I don\u2019t believe it delivers Brexit,\u201d Conservative MP and top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said on the BBC Tuesday.\nThe anger from the \u201cBrexiteer\u201d wing focuses primarily on the inclusion of a \u201cbackstop\u201d -- a safety net that keeps Britain in a customs union with the E.U.\nin case no trade deal is made after March.\nIt is intended to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but Brexiteers have pointed to the lack of a unilateral exit mechanism as evidence that the backstop will lead to Britain never actually leaving.\nIf May's agreement loses by more than 100 votes, it would likely renew calls from her own party for her to step down, and give impetus to the opposition Labour Party to put forward a motion of no-confidence -- a move

second referendum, by which Brits would get a do-over on the 2016 referendum -- something May has rejected outright.\nThat proposal has been condemned by many Brexit supporters as an effort to scrub out the 2016 referendum, what they say is a trend in Europe by which voters are made to vote again and again until they vote the \"right\" way.\nIn the face of withering criticism, May and her allies have been pushing back, hoping to keep the margin of defeat to a minimum.\nMay told a packed House of Commons ahead of the vote that \"I believe we have have a duty to deliver on the choices of the

and some business groups have said would lead to chaos from an economic downturn to a lack of access to vital medicines as Britain\u2019s ports clog up.\nMAY SLAMS TONY BLAIR'S NEW BREXIT VOTE

had already been merged with England in 1536.\nIreland on the other hand was a subjugated English (latterly British) colony, and was officially brought into the orbit of what would then be known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.\nIn 1922, after a prolonged national liberation struggle in Ireland, the 26 counties that make up today\u2019s Republic of Ireland achieved dominion status before winning full independence in 1948, while the remaining six counties that make up the entire island, or Ireland, were partitioned to become what is now Northern Ireland: hence the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of today.\nThis necessary historical detour out of the way, here is where things start to bear relevance to Brexit.\nAn unintended consequence of the Industrial Revolution that saw Britain (UK) go on to forge an empire which at its height covered a quarter of the globe, was the forging of a unified working class whose unity transcended national, cultural and regional differences.\nThis class unity was the product of the country\u2019s heavy industries \u2013 coal mining, steel, shipbuilding, etc.\u2013 and was expressed in common economic interests and struggles against a common enemy, the bosses and owners of those industries, in the context of the trade union movement..\nIt also began to manifest politically with the formation of the Labour Party at the start of the 20th century.\nIn tandem, forged over time, was a British national identity nourished by the countless wars the state\u2019s ruling elite unleashed and waged over the centuries of an empire that existed not to spread civilization and modernity to the \u2018dark peoples\u2019 of the planet, as officially claimed, but as a juggernaut of exploitation, subjugation and oppression.\nIn those countless colonial wars working class men were used as cannon fodder in a dynamic that continues to the present day.\nRead more\nMargaret Thatcher destroyed this material basis of working class unity across the UK in the 1980s.\nHer free market counter-revolution and resulting deindustrialization of the nation\u2019s economy turned Britain into what it is today \u2013 a service economy underpinned by financialized capital.\nThe country\u2019s trade union movement, which once wielded considerable economic and political clout, is but a shadow of its former self as a consequence, while the Labour Party was gutted of its founding principles by Tony Blair and his execrable centrist crew in the 1990s and on into the first decade of the noughties.\nIt is the remnants of this Blairite crew within the Labour Party who have and continue to be engaged in a concerted effort to undermine the party\u2019s current socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn.\nSuch people, working alongside a reactionary Tory establishment, should be careful what they wish for.\nBecause in 2019 it is only Corbyn\u2019s socialist program, offering economic and social transformation, that provides any hope of repairing the regional, national and cultural fault lines that correspond to the breakdown of the 2016 EU referendum vote.\nThe post-industrial north and midlands of England, parts of the country virtually untouched by investment and left without hope after being decimated by Thatcher, voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in a veritable scream from the bowels of austerity Britain.\nEvery one of Scotland\u2019s 32 local authorities, meanwhile, voted Remain.\nWales, particularly post-industrial south Wales, voted for Brexit, while a five percent majority in Northern Ireland voted Remain.\nIt confirms that what was once the United Kingdom is now the dis-United Kingdom, with those previously mentioned national and regional differences informing its peoples\u2019 identities and worldview over the identity of class to an extent previously unseen.\nBrexit in this context is a sideshow, a pantomime largely being played out in parliament and the centrist mainstream.\nAs Karl Marx put it: \u201cTo call upon people to give up their illusions about their condition, is to call upon them to give a condition that requires illusions.\u201d\nThe illusion that Brexit is actually relevant to the needs of those who\u2019ve seen their lives devoured by the beast of neoliberalism and bludgeoned by austerity must soon give way to the unvarnished truth that the UK as we know it, is past its sell-by date\n\u201cA reactionary,\u201d the great postwar Labour figure Nye Bevan once said, \u201cis a man walking backwards with his face to the

Strikes Back\u2014And Misses.\nGood Omen For Trump?\n| Articles\nThe parallels between British and American politics are simply eerie.\nIn 2016, after British voters unexpectedly rebelled against their political class and chose to leave the European Union, Donald J. Trump took to calling himself Mr. Brexit\u2014and guess what?\nSince then, of course, the political classes in both countries have been conspiring to reverse the election results.\nBut Theresa May just suffered the greatest defeat of any British Prime Minister when her BRINO (Brexit In Name Only) deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by the House of Commons 432-202.\nSubsequently, May has survived a vote of No Confidence and the outlook is confused.\nBut clearly the Deep State has not yet tamed British populism.\nA good omen for Trump?\nMay\u2019s defeat was terrible enough, but it was even worse because the \u201cpayroll vote,\u201d of Members of Parliament (= Congressmen) holding government office, is around 140.\nHence, BRINO only attracted around 60 backbenchers (who within reason can vote as they like).\nThe Spectator has a list, with names, of the 118 Tories to voted against May\u2019s deal.\nThis gives May and her government a tremendous problem because ever since she came back with the draft deal she has been saying it is her way or the highway, stubbornly insisting that no other deal is available.\nBut such was the deal\u2019s subordination of UK interests that many commentators argued would leave the UK as a vassal state.\n[May\u2019s Brexit deal: the legal verdict | The PM\u2019s plan isn\u2019t bad \u2013 it\u2019s atrocious, by Martin Howe QC, Spectator, November 24, 2018]\nThis fiasco is largely due to having a Remainer PM (May opposed Brexit although she wasn\u2019t brave about it) and a Remainer-dominated cabinet.\nAt best their heart isn\u2019t in Brexit; at worst they are deliberately trying to sabotage it.\nSimilarly, many Trump Administration officials and GOP Congressional leaders have been all too obviously hostile to his agenda.\nWith a Leaver PM and a Leaver-dominated Cabinet, there would still have been a potential problem with Remainer-dominated Houses of Commons and Lords.\nBut it is doubtful that Remainers in Parliament would have been so blatant in their attempts to frustrate a straightforward Brexit.\nThe defeat of May\u2019s deal is encouraging for Brexiteers inasmuch as the overwhelming result should have greatly lessened any thoughts May had of coming back with a few insignificant cosmetic changes.\nHowever, it\u2019s still a possibility.\nAnd there are many other threats to thwart a true Brexit.\nIf there is a serious breakdown of party discipline, there is nothing to stop Remainer MPs doing anything they want because the House of Commons still has a substantial majority of Remainers.\nBut a bright spot for Brexiteers: the date for the UK\u2019s leaving is fixed in an Act of Parliament.\nSection 20 of the European Union (Withdrawal ) Act 2018 states \u2018\u201cexit day\u201d means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m.\u2019\nTo change the date of the UK leaving the EU requires either an amendment to or a repeal of the Act.\nAnd unless the Brexit leaving date is changed, it does not matter what else happens, because there is a legal obligation on the UK to leave.\nA second referendum cannot be held, an extension of Article 50 cannot be sought by the UK or granted by the EU and Article 50 cannot be revoked.\nIn addition Remainers, however aided and abetted by the unethical Remainer Speaker of the Commons John Bercow, cannot ultimately stop the UK leaving the EU on 29 March.\nThere are serious obstacles to the House of Commons voting to amend or repeal the leaving date.\nTo begin with it would nakedly expose the Remainers\u2019 anti-democratic partisanship.\nEver since the referendum, most Remainers have consistently bleated that they honored the result, although obviously hoping to sabotage Brexit.\nHaving their true feelings exposed will be more than embarrassing, because there are many constituencies (= Congressional districts), especially ones held by Labour MPs, that voted heavily to leave the EU while their MP voted Remain.\nLeave voters might well punish Remainer MPs in Leave constituencies.\nThen there is the entirely practical alternative option of a No-Deal Brexit\u2014more precisely, leaving without any negotiated deal with the European Union and proceeding to trade under World Trade Organization rules.\nSignificant numbers of Leave MPs have embraced the idea, for two reasons: first, it simplifies matters because it is ready-made system and allows business to plan; second is that it makes it harder for remainder politicians to sabotage Brexit after the UK has formally left the EU.\nOf course, WTO membership does not mean that future bilateral trade deals cannot be struck.\nSo what is really happening\u2014in the U.K. and the U.S.?\nThe Deep State is often portrayed as a conspiracy.\nIn fact, it is better thought of as a blind sociological event.\nThere is no group of conscious conspirators, simply people being groomed to have the same opinions or at least saying they do.\nWhat has happened in the UK (and the rest for the West to varying degrees) is the success of the long march through the institutions.\nThat is what ultimately has given the UK an elite (politicians, mediafolk, teachers etc) who are overwhelmingly Politically Correct internationalists.\nAnd it\u2019s those people who are at the forefront of the attempts to sabotage Brexit.\nHow did it come about?\nA German student leader of the 1960s Rudi Dutschke, echoing the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, put forward the idea whereby societies could be subverted from within by those of an internationalist bent who would patiently work to gain positions of power and influence.\nEventually there would be enough of such people to change the policies of Western societies from national to internationalist ones.\nThat point was reached in the UK at least 50 years ago and the Politically Correct stranglehold on our society is now complete.\nThe capture of Western societies by internationalists has allowed them to permit and even overtly encourage mass immigration of people from different cultures, denigrate their own societies, traduce the West and its native populations generally and introduce gradually the pernicious Totalitarian creed of Cultural Marxism which has \u201canti-racism\u201d (in reality anti-white racism) at its heart.\nThe last brick in the Politically Correct building is the increasingly draconian treatment of anyone who refuses to toe the line\u2014increasingly including the use of the criminal law and imprisonment.\nThat is why Western politics until recently has been so ideologically monotone.\nBrexit was a revolt against that mentality.\nMost MPs overtly or tacitly supported the idea of the referendum and its result by promising it in election manifestos, in Parliament and through their passage by large majorities of the legislation needed to both set up the referendum and make provision for its implementation.\nBut by doing so, MPs forfeited their right to do anything other than honour the result of the referendum.\nThat applies just as much to Remainer MPs as Leaver MPs.\nSadly, the behaviour of the most committed Remainers with power and influence (including many MPs and peers in the House of Lords) has shattered utterly the idea that the UK is a fully functioning democracy.\nRather, it is an elective oligarchy whereby the electorate are offered an opportunity every few years to choose between competing parts of the elite\u2014an elite in the UK whose general political ideas are largely held in common and go against the interests and wishes of most of the electorate.\nNone of this should be a surprise.\nThe sad truth: the central political question in all Western societies is\u2014how far will the masses be able to control the naturally-abusive tendencies of the elite?\nRobert

they would not vote.\nOpponents of the EU largely led the polling landscape from 2012 to 2015.\nSubscribe to Observer\u2019s Politics Newsletter\nFrom 2015 to 2016, there was a seesaw battle between proponents of Brexit and opponents, who wanted to stay in the EU.\nIt seemed to change from survey to survey.\nThe supporters of leaving the EU narrowly won out, largely due to wild claims from Brexit supporters, like the UK Independence Party (UKIP), that the country would make a lot of money by leaving the EU.\nIn addition, support for Brexit was also fueled by opposition to Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, a free market champion and EU supporter who became pretty unpopular quickly due to a series of scandals, and his policies that struggled to help the UK recover from the Great Recession.\nI went into a Conservative Party club in 2012 in Oxford and could barely find a Cameron supporter in his own party\u2019s get-together.\nI found just a tiny photo of him that had been moved to the back of the building.\nSupport for the EU Rises\nBut something happened after the Brexit vote.\nPolls show that the number of undecided votes dropped precipitously, and support for the EU rose.\nAs people realized that voting for Brexit wasn\u2019t like winning the lottery, and that the country was due to face a lot of economic pain for breaking with the European Union, support for Brexit slipped in the polls.\nAdditional polls consistently show that those favoring the EU would win a new referendum, as people realize the consequences of Brexit, as well as the false promises such a plan won\u2019t deliver.\nMay, who assumed power after Cameron resigned, sought to capitalize on the Brexit vote by calling for early elections.\nInstead, this Brexit cheerleader was humiliated at the polls, and her party lost its majority in power, relying on a Northern Ireland party to cling to power.\nMay sought to negotiate the Brexit plan with the EU.\nBut the plan was so unpopular in 2018 that she tabled it, hoping the House of Commons would like it better in 2019.\nThey liked it less, leading to May\u2019s Waterloo in the vote.\nNot since Tory Prime Minister Lord North received the news from Yorktown about the success of the American Revolution has a British politician been so humiliated.\nTime for Another Vote\nFailing to learn the lessons of her defeat, May refused to call for a new referendum, calling such a move \u201cantidemocratic.\u201d But what\u2019s more antidemocratic: giving the people a new vote and a second chance, or leaving her tiny parliamentary coalition in

means.\u201d\nFormer Labor PM Tony Blair, and former Conservative PM John Major, have called for a new vote, showing a rare moment of bipartisanship.\nPolls estimate that at least 55 percent of the British people want to stay.\nIt\u2019s time to have a fake news-free referendum that doesn\u2019t involve racism or the stabbing death of a parliamentarian who opposed Brexit.\nLet the British

only indirect interest to us Americans, but it does show another aspect of the slow political revolution taking place all over the Western world.\nAs our own correspondent Robert Henderson posted here at VDARE.com on Thursday, the Brexit vote of June 2016\u2014the vote by British people to leave the European Union\u2014was of a piece with the election of Donald Trump five months later.\nBoth events represented a revolt by ordinary citizens against entrenched Deep State elites and their media, corporate, and academic shills.\nTwo-plus years on, it's clear on both sides of the Atlantic that those entrenched elites were more entrenched than the revolutionaries supposed.\nBoth in the U.S.A. and Britain, they have put up a mighty resistance to the loss of their power and influence.\nSo which revolution is doing better, ours or theirs?\nOn the evidence of this week, I'd have to say Britain's is ahead.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated a deal with the EU, a package of conditions under which Britain could finally leave the EU on March 29th.\nIt was a lousy deal for the Brits, keeping the nation chained to the EU bureaucracy in a hundred ways.\n\"BINO\" I called it back in December\u2014Brexit in Name Only.\nRobert Henderson prefers BRINO, and I'm okay with that: the perception is the same.\nTuesday this week Britain's parliament finally got to vote on Mrs May's deal.\nThey voted it down.\nThat generated a mini-crisis as the opposition party in parliament called a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.\nThat vote, however, went Mrs May's way, so she remains in power.\nBut since parliament's rejected her deal, what are the terms under which Britain will leave the EU on March 29th?\nA strong possibility now is: no terms.\nThis is the so-called \"hard Brexit.\"\nBritain just walks out, leaving the bureaucrats and businessmen to sort things out among themselves as best they can.\nThere would be chaos and confusion; but, as Adam Smith said, there's a deal of ruin in a nation.\nThe Brits have faced far worse within living memory.\nWhen the dust settled they'd have their sovereignty back, and could set their own laws in their own parliament for their own people again.\nThat would be worth a bit of chaos.\nA great many Brits agree.\nHere's a sound clip from last week.\nIt's from a weekly show on BBC-TV called Question Time, in which a panel of pundits and politicians takes questions from a studio audience.\nThis being the BBC the panels are slanted left-liberal, making it usually a pretty dull show.\nThis Thursday's Question Time panel, however, included political journalist Isabel Oakeshott.\nFollowing those earlier events of the week, the question of course came up: Is there now any alternative to a \"hard Brexit\"?\nMs Oakeshott took the question.\nHere's what she said:\nOakeshott: Well, the answer \u2026 look, I can save everybody a lot of time here \u2026\nEmcee: Oh, do!\nBecause it's been two years, so, so, \u2026\nOakeshott: The short answer is: No, there isn't.\nAnd that is why it seems to me the only option for Theresa May now\u2014and I'm going to admit that it is a sub-optimal position\u2014is to walk away.\nThat is all she can do.\nEmcee: So to leave with no deal.\nOakeshott: Yes, absolutely, because that isn't \u2026 (Drowned out by prolonged cheering and applause from the studio audience.)]\nJust listen to that studio audience!\nHard Brexit?\nThey love it!\nThe TV coverage is even more telling.\nThey're happy, with the happiness of people who just heard an authority figure\u2014Ms Oakeshott is the privately-educated offspring of an upper-class family\u2014an authority figure taking their side against the elites.\nI can't forbear adding that Question Time is a peripatetic show, set in a different city each week.\nThursday's show was set in Derby, which is of course the capital city of Derbyshire \u2026\nIt's worth adding also that the Brits seem still to have some of their resourcefulness in the face of impending chaos.\nThe London Daily Mail, January 18th, reports a severe shortage of warehouse space in Britain on account of British firms stockpiling all kinds of goods, including food.\nThe firms fear that chaos over the absence of customs rules at ports of entry following a hard Brexit will slow down or stop entry of goods.\nThat's private action, not government action; but I'm reminded of Margaret Thatcher and the crisis with Britain's coal miners in the early 1980s.\nWhen the miners' union leaders first started acting up, Thatcher appeased them with soft talk.\nMeanwhile, behind the scenes, she called in her Energy Secretary Nigel Lawson and told him to start stockpiling coal.\nWhen the stockpile was big enough, Thatcher turned on the miners and confronted them boldly, from a position of strength.\nShe was a smart lady, and that's smart government.\nYou listening, Mr President?\n", ["Appeal_to_Popularity",

minister Theresa May unveiled her Brexit Plan \"B\" yesterday after Parliament decisively rejected her original plan to take Great Britain out of the European Union last week.\nAssociated Press:\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party accused May of being in \"deep denial\" about her doomed deal.\n\"This really does feel a bit like 'Groundhog Day,'\" he said, referring to the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, in which a weatherman is fated to live out the same day over and over again.\nOutlining what she plans to do after her EU divorce deal was rejected by Parliament last week, May said that she had heeded lawmakers' concerns over an insurance policy known as the \"backstop\" that is intended to guarantee there are no customs checks along the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Brexit.\nMay told the House of Commons that she would be \"talking further this week to colleagues ... to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House.\n\"And I will then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU.\"\nThe bloc insists that it won't renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.\nThe problem with the Northern Ireland \"backstop\" is that May and the E.U.\nkicked the can down the road for a permanent solution.\nPlan \"B\" isn't much better:\nThe backstop proposes to keep the U.K. in a customs union with the EU in order to avoid checks on the Irish border.\nIt is meant as a temporary measure that would last until a permanent solution is found.\nBut pro-Brexit U.K. lawmakers fear Britain could become trapped in it, indefinitely bound by EU trade rules.\nPolish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz broke ranks with EU colleagues Monday by suggesting the problem could be solved by setting a five-year time limit on the backstop.\nThe idea got a cool reception.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that \"putting a time-limit on an insurance mechanism, which is what the backstop is, effectively means that it's not a backstop at all.\"\nThe Labor Party is calling for a second referendum, which is political show and not a serious proposal \u2013 at least at this point.\nA referendum couldn't be planned and executed by the March 29 deadline, and besides, there is no legal mechanism to withdraw Great Britain from Article 50 of the E.U.\ncharter \u2013 the legal basis they have invoked to withdraw from the E.U.\nin the first place.\nMay is stuck and appears trapped between opposition

Irish backstop.\nWithout finding \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that the EU will agree to, the PM will find it difficult to push through her deal at a second attempt in two weeks' time.\nShe's

contemplate removing the Irish backstop as it would threaten Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement.A spokesperson for European Council President Donald Tusk, issued a firm statement on Tuesday evening

III Lost America.\nTheresa May Could Lose the United Kingdom Over Brexit.\nBritain is locked in the most serious peacetime crisis in its modern history, the increasingly desperate attempt to secure the nation\u2019s orderly departure from the European Union.\nBrexit has shown the world a British parliament and a political class that resembles a ship of fools without a captain.\nOne veteran of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet said that voters are looking at parliament \u201cwith something rather near to contempt.\u201d\nWe speak of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the Western world.\nSince 1721 it has seen 74 prime ministers of highly varied competence and backgrounds but few if any as incapable of steering the country through perilous times as the current incumbent, Theresa May, who could end up being compared to George III because of the consequences of her ineptitude.\nThe ultimate test of a prime minister in a crisis is always the same\u2014how well do they measure up to the moment?\nThe answer to that depends on a combination of skills.\nQuite often they are skills that politicians do not find in themselves until they are called upon by destiny to prove them.\nDifferent times need different abilities.\nSometimes a prime minister who at the time seems mediocre is later reassessed and seen to have been more consequential than anyone realized because he was overshadowed by a predecessor.\nIn British history there is a classic instance of this: In 1945 Winston Churchill was rudely and unexpectedly removed from office in a general election and replaced by the leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee.\nChurchill, the country\u2019s greatest ever war leader, was contemptuous of his successor whom he described as \u201ca modest little man with a lot to be modest about.\u201d\nIt turned out that Attlee (who was deputy prime minister during the war) was precisely what the nation needed, not only to get through years of austerity imposed by the near-bankruptcy created by the war effort, but as the parliamentary leader with the skills to re-engineer British society and provide its people with a comprehensive safety net including, notably, free universal health care for life.\nSo here were two men equally indispensable in their abilities, one to lead and the other to heal.\nIn each case their mastery reflected their character, Churchill who was able to project himself as the living embodiment of a great national narrative of obdurate resistance and victory and Attlee as the quiet but systematic architect of change.\nAnd today Britain has Theresa May.\nIt is too generous to say that May has had trouble measuring up the to moment.\nShe has trouble explaining what the moment actually is\u2014the utterance that will forever be her epitaph in the history of political discourse will be \u201cBrexit means Brexit.\u201d\nImagine Churchill saying \u201cwar means war.\u201d OK, let\u2019s be reasonable.\nWhen it comes to oratory nobody can hold a candle to Churchill.\nEvery prime minister since Churchill has carefully avoided getting into that kind of contest.\nBut when the qualities of leadership are under scrutiny it\u2019s important to understand that Churchill was as courageously decisive in private as he was in public.\nThere is a passage in Andrew Roberts\u2019 sweeping new biography, Churchill, Walking With Destiny, describing a moment where the prime minister speaks ad lib and without leaving his own record of what was, literally, one of the statements that saved Britain.\nHe was speaking to men not as resolved as himself who needed to believe in him as an army needs to believe in its generals.\nIt came in the early summer of 1940 when Churchill, who had taken over only a week before, was resisting attempts to negotiate with Hitler.\nHe told his new cabinet: \n\u201cI have thought carefully in these last days whether it was part of my duty to consider entering into negotiations with That Man.\nBut it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out.\nThe Germans would demand our fleet\u2014that would be called \u2018disarmament\u2019\u2014our naval bases and much else.\nWe should become a slave state\u2026 If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.\u201d\nNo official minute was taken of that statement\u2014Roberts quotes it as recorded later in the diary of a cabinet member.\nWhat is new now is that Theresa May brings to the office a background like no other before her.\nShe is the first person to hold that office who is by both experience and instincts a bureaucrat.\nHer rise to the Tory party leadership owed much to her success as a bureaucrat.\nShe ran a government department that was so large and so challenging to master that some prime ministers were known to have deliberately given it to rivals in order to destroy their careers: the Home Office, a Whitehall edifice that could perhaps be compared to a nightmare package embracing the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Homeland Security.\nShe was put there by David Cameron, a prime minister who was himself notoriously bored by administrative details and, as his decision to hold a national referendum on Brexit demonstrated, not too smart at judging outcomes.\nMay survived with a mixed record at the Home Office.\nShe acquired something of the reputation of a control freak, devoted to organizational charts and preferring to run the department through a small and tight-knit clique of loyal aides and Tory Party law-and-order zealots.\nChurchill, famous for asking for opinions \u201con one half sheet of notepaper,\u201d said that a camel is what you end up with if you ask a committee to design a horse.\nMay was fond of setting up committees and official inquiries to avoid taking action and produced many camels.\nOne of her former cabinet ministers despaired that \u201cit\u2019s a fantastic skill, her ability to do nothing.\u201d\n\u201c Alas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat\u2019s particular gift of killing language.\nThe English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.\n\u201d\nLater she managed to swat away responsibility for an ugly debacle during her watch.\nWest Indians who immigrated to Britain in the 1950s were threatened with mass deportation because they had no record of legally arriving\u2014then it turned out that the Home Office itself had discarded the documentation.On the face of it her bureaucratic cast of mind should have been an asset when facing the complexities involved in negotiating Britain out of all the political, legal and commercial attachments to the European Union.\nAfter all, the country was not facing a lethal existential threat.\nThis was a self-initiated unraveling of laws and treaties.\nBut the EU is the world\u2019s largest assembly of bureaucrats, a characteristic often damned by the pro-Brexit campaign, as well as by more reasoned critics.\nA negotiation of this complexity had never been attempted by anyone before.\nIt needed a team that combined a complete command of administrative detail, a shrewd sense of the national interest, an equally shrewd assessment of the opposing interests, and an ability to understand the difference between bottom-line economic interests and the EU\u2019s loftier moral values as an alliance committed to protecting constitutional democracy in a continent with an unhappy history of autocracies.\nThis was a tough deal for anyone to successfully achieve.\nBut any leader who was able not only to pull it off but to sell it to their people\u2014in the case of the UK to a people divided by a referendum margin as close as 52 to 48 percent\u2014needed to have something else.\nThey had to be able to bring eloquence and vision to their argument.\nAlas, because May is a bureaucrat she has the bureaucrat\u2019s particular gift of killing language.\nThe English language, so rich in its ability to move people, dies in her mouth.\nThe closest she has ever come to articulating the case for the Brexit deal she negotiated that set up a 21-month transition period for achieving a new free trade agreement with the EU (the deal that she is again stuck with trying to amend and resuscitate despite that fact that the EU has warned it will not renegotiate) was to say, repetitively, \u201cIt is in the national interest for everyone to get behind it.\u201d\nBasically when the narrow majority of Brits voted for Brexit they voted for something that didn\u2019t actually exist.\nThere was not even the vaguest outline of the real impact that Brexit would have on British life.\nIts proponents, even if they had any sense of the outcome (which is doubtful) weren\u2019t interested in pesky details.\nThey were appealing to raw emotions, largely anti-immigrant xenophobia, not advancing a rational argument.\nThe Brexit deal that May presented to parliament went down in the biggest defeat any prime minister has suffered, 432 votes to 202.\nAll along she had been trying to reconcile elements that are not reconcilable: keeping the support of her party\u2019s lunatic fringe that is undismayed by the prospect of a \u201cno deal\u201d exit that would bring extreme self-harm while also holding the loyalty of the center of the party\u2014and doing this while satisfying the terms the EU is prepared to allow.\n(\u201cAllow\u201d is the realistic term because Britain has always been a supplicant.)At the same time she survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote that leaves her in power while seriously wounded and without a new deal that is likely to fly.\nJeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, is similarly ineffectual and unready to meet the leadership tests of his time.\nHis party includes a rump of Brexiters and his cabinet is in thrall to fossilized Marxist ideas.\nHis rhetorical skills are, if anything, less evident than May\u2019s.\nGiven two clueless party leaders it often seems that all the politicians are overcome by the kind of helpless rapture that sent Thelma and Louise driving blissfully over the cliff.\nIn 1940 Churchill\u2019s freedom of action was greatly helped by the fact that he did not have to bow to any party\u2019s dictates.\nHe was appointed prime minister without being leader of the Tory party\u2014the leader remained his predecessor as prime minister, Neville Chamberlain.\nUniquely, Churchill led a coalition of the Tory, Labour and Liberal parties at a time when none of those parties would probably have accepted him as their party leader.\nAs a result of this freedom he was able to isolate and negate the influence of the appeasers who did not like the prospect of choking in their own blood.\nHe could and did appeal directly to the spirit of a parliament and a people who set aside partisan interests in favor of a higher purpose, victory that was by no means assured.\nThe irony now is that Brexiters represent only 15 percent of the 650 members of the House of Commons.\nA large majority is opposed to Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal.\nA prime minister not constrained by party loyalties could easily get support for a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit\u2014meaning a measured transition from full membership to one that keeps the country in a permanent customs union without disruption.\nInstead, by trying vainly to satisfy everyone May is satisfying nobody except people like the loony Little Englanders who say that such a deal would leave Britain as a \u201cslave state.\u201d\nIf they get their way May could well go down in history as the prime minister who lost the kingdom\u2014the United Kingdom.\nScotland wants nothing to do with Brexit and if it is imposed on them the Scottish parliament will probably vote to end the Acts of Union of 1707 that created the United Kingdom in order to leave them free to join the EU.\nThe implications are wider than that.\nLeaders in the European Union\u2014including Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel\u2014are now fretting that the EU without Britain will be less able to clamp down on the kind of populist taste for autocrats that is afflicting Poland and Hungary.\nGeorge III went down in history as the king who lost America.\nNobody in particular was held culpable for losing the empire\u2014that was an inevitability of history that imposed its own logic and timing.\nIf the United Kingdom becomes Little England (albeit including Wales and Northern Ireland) it will have reverted to the boundaries of the land it was in 40 A.D. when the Romans made a coherent colony out of a rabble of warring tribes.\nAnd this fiasco will be owned by a parliament that allowed a deranged minority to win and a prime minister who was never remotely equal to the greatest challenge of her time.\n", ["Conversation_Killer", "Repetition", "Red_Herring", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Straw_Man",

one of the \u201cother options\u201d available, in case Britain\u2019s planned withdrawal from the E.U.\nnext month goes badly.CCorbyn wrote a public letter to Prime Minister Theresa May this week, outlining what kind of agreement Labour would support with the E.U.\npost-withdrawal.It included a customs union and a generally close relationship with the E.U., but was silent on the question of second referendum.\nIn a recent survey by Opinium, 22 percent of young Labour voter respondents indicated they could move away from the party on the grounds it hasn\u2019t done enough to stop the planned exit.\nA YouGov poll in December found similarly that support for Labour among 18 to 29-year-olds would drop from 60 to 33 percent if the party supported Brexit in any form.\nBritish media outlets this week published parts of a leaked private report drawn up for a Labour-allied trade union, which reportedly described failure to oppose Brexit as more damaging to the party than its support for the Iraq war in 2003.\nMeanwhile student leaders have warned that Labour is in danger of losing \u201cmillions\u201d of voters.\nA front-page advertisement in Corbyn\u2019s local newspaper in London featured a call from more than 100 activists for a public vote.\nChris Stafford, an expert in British politics at the University of Nottingham, said this week Corbyn\u2019s strategy has been to stay in the background while May\u2019s Conservative Party \u2013 which has pro- and anti-E.U.\nwings \u2013 has torn itself apart over Brexit.\nBut after waiting and biding his time, Stafford said, Corbyn is now under pressure to make his position clear.\n\u201cIt is hard to criticize the government and say you would do it better while not offering a concrete alternative,\u201d he said.\nThere has been public talk of a group of lawmakers breaking away from Labour, although Stafford said he doubted a new party would attract that many voters.\u201cWhen it comes to election day most people stick with one of the bigger parties because they don\u2019t want to \u2018waste\u2019 their vote on a different [smaller] one,\u201d he said.\nStafford said while polls suggest Labour is losing support, Corbyn could regain popularity if he takes a stance that makes his party distinct from the Conservatives.\nMay has pledged not to run again for prime minister.\nStafford said that, while much will depend on who the Tories choose as their next leader, the complete disarray within the Conservative Party will help Corbyn look like a better option.\nCall for U.S.-style primaries\nThis week, a prominent Labour activist called for American-style primaries to be introduced when it came to selecting candidates for parliament.\nAaron Bastani, a writer with links to Corbyn, tweeted that if people thought newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) embodied excellent politics it was important to remember she got into office through a primary.\n\u201cWe need the best leaders in parliament,\u201d he tweeted.\n\u201cPrimaries, along with mandatory reselection, is how.\u201d\nCurrently, candidates in both the Labour and Conservative parties are selected through local party organizations, often with input from the party\u2019s national office.\nIn 2009, in what was billed as a first, a physician named Sarah Wollaston was selected as a Conservative Party candidate through an open primary held through the mail.\nShe won, and now sits in the House of Commons representing Totnes in southwest England.\nWollaston said Thursday that the experiment allowed local voters to choose from a wide range of candidates, both experienced politicians and newcomers.\nNon party members were allowed to participate as well, in a constituency that has a solid tradition of electing Conservatives.\n\u201cIn a so called safe seat, open primaries give voters the chance to select a candidate who, if subsequently elected, would at least be nearer their own political views,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut the postal method is expensive and I think this has made it difficult to sustain.\u201d\n", ["Appeal_to_Popularity", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language",

Williamson is itching for conflict with Russia and China.\nHe\u2019s not mad.\nNot even slightly.\nBut he is stupid.\nVery.\nUnlike former fireplace salesman Gavin Williamson, I am no military expert.\nBut then you do not need to be one to understand that while Britain going to war with Russia and China might work as a video game, the real thing would be an exceedingly bad idea.\nSo why then in a speech delivered to the Royal United Services Institute in London, did Mr Williamson\u2019s argument on the feasibility of the real thing elicit applause rather than the shrieks of horror and demands he be sacked forthwith it should have?\nThis is a serious question, by the way.\nIt is one that cuts through British establishment verbiage to reveal a country ruled not by the sober and doughty political heavyweights of years gone by, but by foaming fanatics in expensive suits.\nAlso on rt.com We must be ready to use \u2018hard power\u2019 against Moscow and Beijing \u2013 UK defense chief\nPlacing to one side for a moment the insanity of the very concept of Britain deploying hard power against Russia and/or China, the prospect of fighting a war against two designated enemies at the same time is a recipe for disaster.\nNot satisfied with that, though, Mr Williamson is actually contemplating a conflict with three different enemies at the same time \u2013 i.e.\nagainst Russia, China, and the millions of people in Britain his government is currently waging war against under the rubric of austerity.\n\u201cToday, Russia is resurgent,\" Mr Williamson said, \u201crebuilding its military arsenal and seeking to bring the independent countries of the former Soviet Union, like Georgia and Ukraine, back into its orbit.\u201d\nFor Mr Williamson and his ilk a resurgent Russia is a bad thing.\nMuch better in their eyes if Russia, after the Soviet era in the 1990s, had remained on its knees as a free market desert; its state institutions in a state of near collapse and tens of millions of its citizens in the grip of immiseration.\nYes, because in that scenario Western ideologues like him would have had free rein to rampage around the world as they saw fit, setting fire to country after country on the perverse grounds of \u2018saving them\u2019 for democracy.\nRead more\nAs it is, he and his still managed to squeeze in a considerable amount of carnage and chaos in the years it did take Russia to recover.\nThe indictment reads as follows: Yugoslavia destroyed; Afghanistan turned upside down; Iraq pushed into the abyss; Libya sent to hell.\nBy the time they turned their attention to Syria, intent on exploiting an Arab Spring that NATO in Libya transformed into an Arab Winter, Russia had recovered and was able to intervene.\nIt did so in concert with the Syrian Arab Army, Iran and Hezbollah to save the day \u2013 much to the evident chagrin of those who, like Gavin Williamson, prefer to see countries in ashes rather than independent of Western hegemony.\nAs to the facile nonsense about Russia trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine back into its orbit, both countries happen to share a border with Russia and both countries, in recent years, have been used by the UK and its allies as cat\u2019s paws with the eastward expansion of NATO in mind.\nIt gets worse though: \u201cThe Alliance must develop its ability to handle the kind of provocations that Russia is throwing at us.\nSuch action from Russia must come at a cost.\u201d\n\u201cProvocations,\u201d the man said.\nSince British troops have been taking part in exercises on Russia\u2019s doorstep, not the other way round, one wonders if Gavin Williamson wrote this speech while inebriated.\nIt is Russia that has been on the receiving end of repeated provocations from NATO member states such as the UK in recent times, and it is Russia that has been forced to respond to protect its own security and that of its people where necessary.\nFurthermore, not only in Russia but everywhere, including the UK, people understand that when you have political leaders intoxicated by their own national myths and propaganda to such an extent as Britain\u2019s Defence Secretary, danger ensues.\nRead more\nThe most enduring of those national myths where London is concerned is that the British Empire was a force for good rather than a vast criminal enterprise, that Britain and America won the Second World War together alone, that Iraq had WMDs, and that international law and international brigandage really are one and the same thing.\nPerhaps the most preposterous section of the speech came when Mr Williamson tried to fashion a connection between Brexit and Britain\u2019s military strength: \u201cBrexit has brought us to a moment.\nA great moment in our history.\nA moment when we must strengthen our global presence, enhance our lethality, and increase our mass.\u201d\nReading this, you can almost hear Churchill turning in his grave.\nBritain\u2019s wartime prime minister had such as Gavin Williamson in mind when he famously said, \u201cHe has all the virtues I dislike, and none of the vices I admire.\u201d\nMr Williamson obviously misread the memo talking up not the opportunity for increased conflict with China after Brexit but trade.\nThis was not a speech it was a linguistic car crash, one that will forever command an honoured place in compendiums of the worst political speeches ever made.\nAs for Gavin Williamson, just as no responsible parent would ever dream of putting an 10-year old behind the wheel of car to drive unsupervised, no responsible British government would ever appoint a man like him as its Defence Secretary.\nIn years past, he would have struggled to find employment polishing the brass plate outside the building.\nThink your friends would be

["Ireland and the Border\nIreland and the Border\nIreland has been a trouble spot since the invasion of the island by the English king Henry II in 1171, whether to prevent a rival, Strongbow, from controlling the area, or to overcome the damaging opprobrium resulting from the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, on December 29, 1170, by four of his knights.\nDeclaring that Ireland was a part of his empire, Henry II changed the course of Irish history as resident Normans in the area pledged their loyalty to the British crown.\nAlmost a thousand years later, the borders of Ireland remain a difficult political problem, and indeed may have dominated the debate over the last few years over the issue of Brexit.\nEconomic and political relationship between the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland, part of the UK, has been a central factor in the negotiation process of the UK and EU over Brexit.\nThus, the border issue is not simply bilateral, it is also an EU issue.\nThe problem is compounded by the fact that the Brexit issue evokes historical memories as well as having political as well as economic implications.\nAfter Henry II, inhabitants lost territory to new arrivals from England, who formulated the laws.\nThe crucial problem arose with Henry VIII and his decision to leave the Catholic Church and have the country adopt Protestantism, to which many Irish were opposed in their desire to remain Protestant as well as speak their own language, Gaelic.\nOliver Cromwell invaded Ireland to reestablish control over Ireland, massacring over 2,000 of the population in the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649, while Ulster, a Protestant bastion, remained loyal to England, as it still is.\nCromwell remains a villain for many Irish.\nMore troubles ensued during following centuries.\nDuring the great famine 1845-49, Ireland lost more than 1.5 million victims.\nBy 1900 the country had only half the number of inhabitants it had in 1830.\nOn January 1, 1801 the Act of Union united the two areas, previously linked by personal union, into a single kingdom, the United Kingdom.\nThe Chief Secretary, the key administrator in governing Ireland, ruled on behalf of London.\nHowever, the struggle for Irish emancipation starting in the 19thcentury continued.\nAfter the failed Easter Rising against British rule in April 1916, guerrilla war between the IRA and Britain occurred, 1919-1921.\nIt ended in May 1921 with the partitioning of the country, ending British rule in most of Ireland.\nThe Irish Free State was created as a self-governing Dominion in December 1922 while Northern Ireland, NI, remained in the UK.\nFinally, on April 18, 1949 the Republic of Ireland was established, an independent republic, headed by a president.\nHowever, hostilities between the IRA and the government continued in Ulster, virtually 30 years of civil war, including the Bloody Sunday incident on January 30, 1972 when 28 unarmed civilians were killed by British troops during a protest March in Derry (Londonderry).\nHostilities lasted until April 10, 1998, Good Friday, which began the peace process.\nGood Friday was concerned with creating an infrastructure of cooperation between north and south, between the Irish government and the newly created power sharing Irish Assembly, in Northern Ireland.\nIt also implied the normalization of relations between Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, and between Britain and the ROI.\nThe normalization would mean the opening of the border which had previously been manned by British soldiers.\nAs a result, since both countries are still in the EU, there are no checks on goods or people moving between Northern Ireland and the ROI.\nThe open border is the most tangible symbol of the peace process as well as of economic cross-border cooperation.\nAll political sides in the Brexit negotiations agree there should not be a \u201chard\u201d border, checks on persons, goods, or infrastructure, dividing NI from the ROI whatever the outcome of final negotiations.\nTherefore, keeping the border open and abiding by the Good Friday Agreement is critical.\nAs a result, Brexit negotiators devised the so-called \u201cbackstop,\u201d a political invention, a fallback position, to keep the border open as much as possible between the ROI and NI, even if no comprehensive trade deal can be reached between UK and EU.\nNI is the only part of the UK that has a land border with another EU country, the ROI.\nBy backstop, the whole of UK, according to Prime Minister Theresa May, would enter in a single customs territory with EU, no tariffs on trade in goods between UK and EU, though NI would be aligned to other rules of the single market.\nTwo problems are related to this.\nOne is that May does not favor a permanent customs deal lest it prevent British free trade deals with other countries.\nThe other is that her proposals have twice been defeated in the House of Commons, on January 15, 2019 by 432-202, and on February 14, 2019 by 303-258.\nIn the latter vote, her own Conservative party, 5 voted against her, and 67 others abstained.\nThe essential features of the EU, single market and customs union, allow people, goods, and services to enter other EU countries without inspection.\nThe basic problem is that if Britain leaves the EU it will probably lead to delays and checks in this policy.\nThe reality would be that the ROI and NI would be in different customs and regulatory regimes, and British goods would be checked at the border.\nThe backstop, a last resort, is intended to prevent full border controls on goods crossing between ROI and NI.\nFor Britain one problem is that it can only end the backstop arrangement with EU agreement.\nThe issue is both economic and political.\nThe fear is that barriers between North and South Ireland might revive the old animosity, the Troubles, the 30-year conflict over NI status as part of the UK.Military controls of the 500-kilometer border were only removed with the Good Friday agreement which provided for more collaboration and free movement between the two entities..\nIrish and British politics enter into the picture.\nFor 10 years in NI the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein worked together in a government coalition.\nPower sharing in NI ended in on January 9, 2017 because of differences between the major parties over the issue of green energy.\nIt led to the general election of June 8, 2017 which resulted in a hung parliament.\nThe Conservatives won 42,4% of the vote and gained 318 of the 50 seats, less than a majority; the Labour Party got 40.0% of the vote and 262 seats.\nOf the Irish parties.\nDUP got 10 and Sinn Fein 7.\nThe UK government therefore relies on the DUP for a majority vote in the House of Commons, which it has twice lost.\nThe Republic of Ireland, like NI, would suffer from a hard border.\nAt the same time, it is benefitting from London-based groups banking institutions, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays, asset management, and insurance companies, who want to retain access to EU markets.\nROI will also benefit from pharmaceutical and legal firms which are moving business to Dublin.\nThe dilemma of Brexit negotiations continues, especially since PM May does not have full support from her Conservative party.\nThe EU may be less inclined to make compromise concessions in view of May\u2019s lack of control of her party.\nA major problem is that the scheduled departure of UK from the EU on March 29 may have to be delayed because of the difficulties in agreeing on future trade and economic relations.\nThe immediate issue is to identity \u201cbackstop\u201d with full clarity, or find a suitable alternative, to prevent a hard border.\n", ["Appeal_to_Popularity", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice"]], ["\u2018Go join Farage\u2019s new party\u2019: Tory minister lashes out at

breakdown in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union has mostly been felt by Theresa May and lawmakers in her Conservative party, who have been at each other\u2019s throats for two years as they stumble towards Brexit.\nBut the main opposition party\u2014Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour\u2014has also been coming apart at the seams.\nThat became even clearer Monday when seven of its lawmakers, unable to back their left-wing leader on Brexit or the way he\u2019s dealt with anti-Semitism in the party, decided to quit.\nSome of the reasons given by the seven members of parliament [MPs] at their dramatic press conference were similar to the bitter arguments which have seen Conservative party politicians angrily fighting amongst themselves.\nNamely, a complete disagreement with their leader on how to go forward with the Brexit referendum result.\nOne of the seven, Chris Leslie, accused Corbyn of a \u201cbetrayal\u201d on Europe by helping to enable May's vision of Brexit and refusing to back a second referendum on the issue.\nAlthough he claims he voted to stay in the EU, Corbyn has been a long-time critic of the bloc and many in his party suspect he\u2019s quite happy to see Britain leave.\nBut it\u2019s the problems unique to Labour that appear to have made the seven most angry and led to the biggest split in the party since the early 1980s.\nLuciana Berger, a Jewish MP who\u2019s been a frequent target of anti-Semites in the party, said that she'd come to the \u201csickening conclusion\u201d that the party had become \u201cinstitutionally anti-Semitic.\u201d\nThe Labour party has been plagued by anti-Semitism incidents since Corbyn became leader with the backing of tens of thousands of new left-wing members.\nA string of incidents last year saw a joint editorial published by the country\u2019s three most prominent Jewish newspapers claiming that a government led by him would pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Jews living in Britain.\nLeslie agreed with Berger, saying that Labour been \u201chijacked by the machine politics of the hard left,\u201d while another of the seven, Mike Gapes, declared angrily: \u201cI am sickened that Labour is now perceived by many as a racist, anti-Semitic party.\u201d\nBerger said she\u2019d become \"embarrassed and ashamed\" to stay in the party, and added that she felt like she was \u201cleaving behind a culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation.\nI look forward to a future serving with colleagues who respect each other.\u201d\nHow many of her former colleagues might join her is unclear.\nSeveral MPs who\u2019ve been severely critical of Corbyn since he became leader have issued statements saying that they still think trying to change the party from within is the best way forward, but that Corbyn has to see Monday\u2019s resignations as the final warning.\nThe seven also made a clear appeal to members of other parties who are uncomfortable with their leaders to join them, with some Conservatives appearing to be open to the idea.\nThe group, and whoever else joins it, will now sit in House of Commons as a loose group of independent members of parliament rather

without the agreement of the EU, potentially forcing it to adhere to the bloc\u2019s customs rules against its will.\nThe staunchly anti-EU wing of May\u2019s Conservative party, the European Research

rejected.\nThe other will see lawmakers vote on whether to extend the 29 March 2019 deadline the U.K. set itself to leave the EU nearly two years ago.\nThat result is harder to predict as even lawmakers who think it\u2019s a good idea will face a backlash from some constituents who will accuse them of trying to abandon the entire Brexit project.\nWhat happens in the longer term is anyone\u2019s guess.\nLawmakers are talking about a number of scenarios: a third vote on May\u2019s deal either before or after a deadline extension; the highly uncertain scenario of leaving with no deal; or taking it to the public with a second referendum, or even a general election.\nIn one scenario forecast by Tory grandee Sir Charles Walker, May will now be forced to call a general election to try and end the impasse.\nThe vice chairman of the influential Conservative 1922 Committee said the administration had dissolved into chaos and\u2014for the first time in at least a

could prevent Brexit entirely.\nOne possibility\u2014if all other options such as no deal or a deadline extension are ruled out\u2014is that the deal is voted on a third time and, faced with prospect no Brexit happening at all, it\u2019s passed.\n\u201cThe reality is Brexiteer MPs need to come on board,\u201d Paul Masterton MP told The Daily Beast.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t, then they are putting their precious project at risk.\nThis is as Brexity as it\u2019s going to get for them.\nIf the deal is defeated then all bets are off.\"\nOne of the few Conservative MPs who fell in behind May on Tuesday night after previously voting against the deal said he was partly motivated by the new concessions from Brussels but \u201cmore importantly if we don\u2019t, there\u2019s a good chance we won\u2019t get any form of Brexit at all.\u201d\nPenning, who helped run May\u2019s leadership campaign, had previously described the prime minister\u2019s deal as \u201cdead as a dodo\u201d but he told The Daily Beast he had changed his mind because he feared his parliamentary colleagues would vote later this week \u201cto block hard Brexit, which means we\u2019ve got no negotiating position;

need two-thirds of the House to vote for it, that ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d he said.\nPenning dismissed speculation that No.\n10 had encouraged Walker to go rogue in TV and radio studios ahead of the vote in order to try and scare a few more Conservatives into backing the prime minister.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know Charlie Walker; he\u2019s a very independently minded MP.\u201d\nIn a bid to stave off an earlier defeat, May was forced to accept that if her deal was rejected for a second time, she would allow MPs to hold a vote the following day on whether they would accept a no-deal Brexit.\nSince the triggering of Article 50\u2014Britain\u2019s formal request to leave the EU\u2014a two-year countdown to March 29, 2019, began.\nAccording to legislation passed by the House and still on the books, Britain will automatically plunge out of the EU in 17 days even if there is no withdrawal agreement.\nA large majority of MPs believe that would be extremely damaging to Britain as decades of trade deals, cross-border agreements, regulations and rights would disappear in a puff of smoke.\nIt is therefore likely that the House of Commons will vote against no deal, that prospect increased when May reacted to her defeat by declaring that there would be a \u201cfree vote\u201d\u2014that means the government effectively does not even have a policy on one of the most important votes in a generation.\nIf Parliament does reject no-deal Brexit, another vote would be automatically triggered for Thursday.\nThis time the question put to lawmakers will be: Should Britain request a delay to Brexit?\nIt is much harder to predict how that vote would play out as both of the main party leaders have effectively lost control of their MPs and would not be able to enforce the party whip.\nSubstantial numbers of politicians on both sides believe delaying Brexit would be an insult to the electorate who voted to quite the EU in 2016; while similarly large numbers believe no deal must be avoided at all costs.\nThere is also a smaller group of MPs who are plotting to hold a second referendum and would therefore vote for as long a delay to Brexit as possible.\nFor once May captured the mood of the House of Commons late Tuesday night when she said: \u201cThese are unenviable choices.\nThanks to the decision that the House has made this evening, they are choices that must

to its EU withdrawal to give a desperate Theresa May more time to find a way out her Brexit mess.\nIn a series of votes Thursday, members of parliament [MPs] voted to instruct May to go back to the EU to request a new Brexit deadline.\nThe British government wants to extend the current deadline for three months if May\u2019s hated Brexit deal is approved by March 29.\nIf she can\u2019t get that through parliament, there could be a much longer delay.\nBritain can\u2019t decide to extend the Brexit deadline by itself, however.\nThat will require the approval of each member state of the EU which is by no means guaranteed unless May can give them good reason to allow her more time for to work on a deal many consider to be dead.\nIf British lawmakers don\u2019t approve May\u2019s deal by March 29, and an extension isn\u2019t approved by the EU, then the country is still set to crash out of the bloc without a deal in 15 days.\nEarlier in the day, the government revealed it intended to hold a third vote on May\u2019s deal some time next week.\nIf it completes a trilogy of defeats, MPs will then get to vote on a range of options to indicate exactly how they want to proceed without May\u2019s deal and without leaving with no deal.\nHowever, changing course would cause a much longer Brexit delay which the government warned could cause \u201creal damage to the public's faith\u201d in politics.\nA British government minister told The Daily Beast that the prime minister will now begin what amounts to a bribery campaign in which she\u2019ll throw money at members of parliament for their pet projects to win their backing for her deal by the end of the new propsed deadline.\n\u201cI suspect the big HMG [Her Majesty\u2019s Government] chequebook is about to be dusted off and promissory notes to fall like confetti,\u201d said the minister\nThe government also hopes the threat of a much longer delay will force the hand of the anti-EU MPs who voted against her deal\u2014believing it would keep the U.K. too closely entwined with Europe\u2014and bring them into line in a potentially-decisive third vote to make sure Brexit happens.\nA spokesman for the European Commission reiterated that a deadline extension would require the \u201cunanimous agreement\u201d of all its member states, and each leader will have to \u201cconsider such a request, giving priority to the need to ensure the functioning of the EU institutions and taking into account the reasons for and duration of a possible extension.\u201d\nA separate vote Thursday saw lawmakers overwhelmingly reject the idea of a second referendum on independence.\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t a legally-binding vote and doesn\u2019t completely rule out the prospect of another referendum, the number of lawmakers who voted against it indicate it is unlikely to win a majority at any time in the near future.\nMPs also rejected the chance to wrestle the Brexit process away from the prime minister by turning down a measure which would have given them control of parliamentary time next week to arrange a series of votes on alternative brexit options.\nThat measure\u2014rejected by just two votes\u2014would have allowed MPs to find a way forward on Brexit without May\u2019s deal.\nThat means MPs have this week voted against May\u2019s deal, against leaving the EU with no deal, against holding a second referendum, and against using their power to find an alternative route to get Britain out of the Brexit stalemate it finds itself in.\nThe decision to delay Brexit came after a week of humiliation for the prime minister\u2014a feeling she must be used to by now.\nLawmakers rejected her deal for a second time on Tuesday night in a defeat which was only marginally better than in January when it suffered the worst defeat in parliamentary history.\nThen, on Wednesday, lawmakers voted against the U.K. ever leaving the EU without a deal.\nAlthough that vote wasn\u2019t legally binding, it was another crushing government defeat which some of her own ministers decided to abstain on.\nMay\u2019s misery wasn\u2019t helped by Donald Trump on Thursday when he said he was \u201csurprised at how badly it has all gone from a standpoint of negotiations\u201d and criticized the prime minister because she didn't listen to his advice on Brexit, commenting: \u201cIt could have been negotiated in a different manner.\u201d May revealed in July last year that Trump told her, in typical Trump fashion, the best way forward would be to sue the EU.Asked if he thinks the Brexit deadline should be extended, Trump said: \u201cI think they are probably going to have to do something, because right now they are in the midst of a very short period of time, at the end of the month and they are not going to be able to do that.\u201d\nHowever, the president warned against a second referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership, saying it would be \u201cunfair to people who have won.\u201d\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Brexit delay request will be rejected if no guarantees of deal success \u2013 France\u2019s Le Drian\nBritain\u2019s request for a

John Danforth as special counsel to head a review of what happened in 1993, after the FBI uncovered information suggesting \u201cincendiary or pyrotechnic devices may have been used.\u201d On July 21, 2000, Danforth released findings that concluded federal agents did not fire shots at members of the religious group, nor did they start the deadly fire.\nHis investigation lasted 316 days.\nThe Starr Report: 1,693 days\nIn January 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske Jr. as the independent counsel in charge of investigating financial irregularities at Whitewater Development Corp., an investment that Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved with.\nIn August 1994, Kenneth Starr replaced Fiske as independent counsel.\nReno approved Starr\u2019s request to expand his investigation to include Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, in January 1998.\nEight months later, on September 9, 1998, Starr released a report to Congress outlining 11 possible grounds for impeachment.\nTwo days later, the report was made public.\nBetween Fiske\u2019s appointment and Starr\u2019s release of his report to Congress, 1,693 days passed.\nUltimately, in February 1999, the Senate acquitted President Clinton of the two articles of impeachment he faced: perjury and obstruction of justice.\nIran-Contra: 2,420 days\nAround 1986, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration sold arms to Iran, which was at war with Iraq.\nIn exchange for the weapons, Iran was supposed to help the United States procure the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.\nProfits from the deal then went to \u201ccontras,\u201d rebel groups who were fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua at the time.\nThe United States was not supposed to sell weapons to Iran or pay ransoms, so Attorney General Edwin Meese III requested that an independent prosecutor be appointed.\nOn Dec. 19, 1986, a panel of judges appointed Lawrence Walsh.\nThe Department of Justice confirmed that appointment a few months later.\nWalsh\u2019s investigation lasted approximately eight years and resulted in charges against 14 people.\nHe submitted his final report to the U.S. Court of Appeals on Aug. 4, 1993, meaning his probe lasted about 2,420 days.\nWrite to Abby Vesoulis at abby.vesoulis@time.com.\n", ["Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Trump and Melania beam as they pose for photos with leaders of Caribbean nations in Mar-a-Lago\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump and the First Lady of the United States didn't appear to be fazed after Robert Mueller handed over his report on the president's Russia connections Friday.\nPOTUS and Melania Trump were grinning from ear-to-ear as they posed for a photo opportunity with Caribbean leaders in Florida as the world waited for a reaction to the probe being officially complete.\nStanding on the steps of Trump's beloved vacation spot, spectators waited for some indication the Special Counsel news may have stirred them.\nScroll down for videos\nMelania and Donald Trump hosted Caribbean leaders at Mar-a-Lago, Florida on Friday\nThe president and First Lady appeared on the same day Robert Mueller handed in his report on possible Trump collusion election with Russia\nWhile her husband is under intense scrutiny, all eyes were on Melania during the photo call.\nMelania wore a linen silk dress from UK brand LK Bennett featuring distracting bold orange, white and black Aztec-inspired prints.\nThe cinched-in-at-the-waist 'Andrea' round-neck occasion dress is currently on sale for $282.50, down from $565.\nMelania paired the midi-length half price frock with Christian Louboutin heels.\nThe First Lady had a breezy attitude as she took to social media to speak about her day with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Haiti President Jovenel Moise, Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet, Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina, and Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.\n'Enjoyed hosting the leaders & their delegations,' she posted on Twitter about the day at West Palm Beach.\nThey posed with leaders from Jamaica, Haiti, Saint Lucia, Dominican Republic and Bahamas\nThe White House residents said they 'enjoyed' and were 'honored' hosting Caribbean leaders\nTrump (3rd left) and Melania (center) hosted (left to right) Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister of Saint Lucia; Danilo Medina S\u00c3\u00a1nchez, President of the Dominican Republic; Andrew Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica; Jovenel Mo\u00c3\u00afse, President of the Republic of Haiti; and Hubert A.

Aides arranged a meeting with the leaders of five Caribbean countries, the president announced his pick to join the Federal Reserve and he bragged about the defeat of the Islamic State.But Trump quickly overshadowed those efforts, issuing a confusing tweet that implied he was undoing North Korea sanctions that his administration had just put in place.\nThe tweet caught many in the White House by surprise and the administration later tried to clarify, insisting he was referring instead to not-yet-imposed sanctions.\nAsk us anything about the Mueller report We\u2019re hosting a live chat on Reddit with former federal investigators who worked on some of the biggest cases since Watergate and our senior reporter, Darren Samuelsohn.\nJoin us on Monday, March 25 at noon ET.\nSubmit your questions in advance here.\nTrump\u2019s Islamic State victory lap was also quickly undercut.\nAt the end of the flight to Florida, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders entered Air Force One\u2019s press cabin wielding a map.\nISIS no longer holds any territory in Syria, she declared, without offering any other details.\nTrump later held up the same map, at one point displaying it upside down, boasting about his success in diminishing the terrorist group.\n\u201cSo here is ISIS on Election Day.\nHere's ISIS right now,\u201d he said.\nThe only problem: the graphic didn\u2019t compare ISIS\u2019s current territory to Election Day in 2016.\nAccording to photographs captured by reporters, it compared the territory to 2014, undercutting the president\u2019s about turning things around immediately after taking office.\n\u201cYou guys can have the map.\nCongratulations.\nYou\u2019ll spread it around,\u201d Trump told reporters, handing them the document.\nSanders quickly snatched up the paper.\nTrump tried to project calm throughout the day, distancing himself from the image of a man about to suffer a political blow.\nOn his arrival at the airport here, he delighted in the adoration of his supporters, signing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.\nBut there were more subtle signs that the White House \u2014 like all of Washington \u2014 had assumed crash position ahead of the transmittal of Mueller\u2019s report to Attorney General Bill Barr, which happened at 5pm, shortly after a sudden blinding hailstorm tore through an already-anxious capital: White House counsel Pat Cipollone joined the president at Mar-a-Lago, according to a person familiar with the matter, as did Sanders, who doesn\u2019t always travel with the president on weekend trips.\n\u201cWe'll see what happens,\u201d Trump had said early in the day as he departed for his weekend in Florida.\n\u201cThere was no collusion.\nThere was no obstruction,\u201d he repeated once again.\n\u201cEverybody knows it.\nIt's all a big hoax.\nIt's all a witch hunt.\u201d\nBut he didn\u2019t mention Mueller for the rest of the day.\nThough the president is often eager to field reporters\u2019 questions, he ignored journalists as he sat alongside the Caribbean leaders, under two gold and crystal chandeliers.\nFor once, it seemed, Trump felt he had nothing more to say.\nHe was content to wait.\nBy late evening, he had resisted tweeting once about Mueller or Russia.\nFriday's fundraising dinner was hosted by the Palm Beach County Republicans.\nTickets for the fundraiser started at $375, with sponsorship packages going as high as $25,000.\nOn Friday afternoon, a person helping to organize the dinner predicted Trump would attend, especially given that the event was held just feet from the room where Trump huddled with the Caribbean leaders.\n\u201cWe very much expect the president to come,\u201d the person said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in his house.\u201d\nThe mood at Mar-a-Lago Friday afternoon was low-key, despite the furor over the Mueller developments swirling in Washington.\nA nearby parking lot was packed with luxury cars, including a bright yellow Porsche and a chrome Rolls Royce.\nA woman in the parking lot sported a black fur coat in the nearly 75-degree weather.\nMueller\u2019s actual conclusions remain under lock and key at the Justice Department.\nBut supporters here seemed unfazed by the report\u2019s imminent disclosure.\nAsked if she\u2019s certain the president can overcome the Mueller probe\u2019s findings, Toni Holt Kramer, a Mar-a-Lago member and founder of the Trumpettes USA, a Trump fan club, said via email, \u201cPositive!!\n!\u201d\nMarc Caputo and Anita Kumar contributed to this story.\n", ["Repetition", "Conversation_Killer", "Straw_Man", "Red_Herring", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Adam Schiff rejects reports that Mueller indictments are over\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff has said that he believes there will likely be further indictments from Robert Mueller as the full contents of his report are looked at in closer detail.\nSchiff suggested he would call the special counsel before a House panel if necessary to learn what is contained in the long-awaited document.\n'If necessary, we will call Bob Mueller or others before our committee, I would imagine the judiciary committee may call the attorney general if necessary,' the California Democrat said during an interview Friday on CNN.\nScroll down for video\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said Friday that he's willing to subpoena Robert Mueller and Attorney General Barr, if needed, to push for disclosure\n'At the end of the day, the department is under a statutory obligation to provide our committee with any information regarding significant intelligence activities, including counterintelligence.\nAnd it's hard to imagine anything more significant than what Bob Mueller has been investigating.\n'We have a right to be informed, and we will demand to be informed about it.'\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller turned over his report to AG William Barr Friday afternoon\nSchiff was asked by Wolf Blitzer if he would be satisfied if 'the most sensitive information' obtained by Mueller was only shared with the so-called 'gang of eight'.\n'No, it would not suffice.\nNow, there may be a select sub-section of information they feel they can only share because of the very sensitive sources which derived the information, but the volumes of information that has been found needs to be shared with the whole committee so we can evaluate what steps have to be taken to protect the country.\n'We're going to need to have the same sort of discovery that we saw during the last Congress, and indeed it may be far more extensive than that, to make sure that U.S. policy is driven by U.S. interest and not because the president or anyone around him is looking to make money from the Kremlin on a tower or anything else.'\nIn another interview with MSNBC, Schiff said that it is entirely likely that more indictments could be forthcoming, saying instead it is 'entirely possible, if not likely, that there will be' more.\n'Well, what it means is that the office of the special counsel, which is essentially a contract attorney to the Justice Department, that that office won't be bringing any further indictments,' he said.\n'It doesn't mean, of course, that main justice or the Seventh District of New York and the Eastern District or others may not bring indictments.\n'In fact, given the lengthy redactions in many of the pleadings of the special counsel eluding to other investigations, I think it's entirely possible if not likely that there will be other indictments.\n'Now, how central or peripheral they'll be to the core issues of potential conspiracy is yet to be determined.'\nHow the news broke: This is the letter Bill Barr, the attorney general, sent to the chairs and ranking members of the Judiciary Committees, revealing the Mueller probe is over\nThough Trump himself has said the report should be made public, it's not clear whether the administration would fight subpoenas for testimony or block the transmission of grand jury material.\nIf the administration decides to fight, lawmakers could ask federal courts to step in and enforce a subpoena.\nA court fight could, in theory, reach the Supreme Court.\nBut few tussles between Congress and the White House get that far.\nThey often are resolved through negotiation.\nThe Democrats, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, could also formally ask Mueller to send his committee evidence that could be used in possible impeachment proceedings against Trump, as suggested by Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding to see the full Mueller report immediately\n'There is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr' shouldn't release the full report, said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer\nWith Attorney General William Barr vowing to rush out information on the report's 'principal conclusions' as soon as this weekend, Democrats were insisting they see both the complete document and the evidence in its entirety.\n'It is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said in a joint statement.\n'Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any 'sneak preview' of Special Counsel Mueller's findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,' the leaders said.\n'The American people have a right to the truth.\nThe watchword is transparency,' they said.\nPresident Donald Trump talks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, in Washington\nSpeaking to reporters Friday, Schumer said: 'The American people have a right to the truth.\nThe watchword is transparency.'\nHe added: 'The president himself has called without qualification or the report to be made public.\nThere is no reason on God's green earth why Attorney General Barr should do any less.'\nSchumer predicted the effort ultimately would prevail due to public sentiment.\n'The demand of the public is overwhelming to see the report when it's on such a serious matter and it will be made public.\nPublic pressure will force it to be,' he said.\nBarr himself pledged transparency during his Senate confirmation hearing.\nBut the strong defender of presidential power also left open the possibility he would share his own summary, rather than the report itself, to Congress \u2013 a move that would provoke a fight with the Democratic House.\nAlthough there were reports Mueller would bring no additional indictments, there remained the possibility of indictments already sealed, or that another body such as the Southern District of New York wold bring indictments.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told MSNBC there was a 'high probability' that could happen.\n'I think there is a strong possibility of additional indictments, including president Trump's family,' Blumenthal said Friday evening.\n'Maybe not by the Department of Justice, main Justice.\nBut by other offices.\nI know that you want to stick to the Mueller report.\nBut the Mueller report cannot be viewed in isolation,' the former prosecutor and Trump nemesis continued.\n'Any more than an investigation, even though it may end, cannot lead to additional investigative leads and actions.\nAnd so I think there's a high probability of additional indictments.'\nWith the White House already resisting document requests from the Democratic Congress, lawmakers want to get hold of Mueller's work product and use it as the basis for additional investigation.\nDemocratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary panels, bluntly told CNN Friday afternoon: 'We want the full report.\nWe want it now.\nWe want it before the president is able to get it or make any edits.'\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who is ramping up his own investigations\nThe president is a subject.\nHe's a subject of the investigation.\nHe has an inherent conflict of interest,' Swalwell continued.\n'It's really inappropriate that he would even touch this.\nIF he didn't do anything wrong, he would keep his hands off it.'\nSand Senate Intelligence Committee Co-chair Democrat Mark Warner: 'Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts of the Mueller report for themselves.\nIt must be provided to Congress immediately, and the AG should swiftly prepare a declassified version for the public.\nNothing short of that will suffice.'\nWarner added on Twitter: 'Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.'\nHouse Judiciary ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia, joined the call for the release of the Mueller report.\n'After nearly two years, the special counsel has concluded his investigation, and I look forward to reviewing Attorney General Barr's report carefully, when it becomes available.\nI fully expect the Justice Department to release the special counsel's report to this committee and to the public without delay and to the maximum extent permitted by law,' Collins said.\n'We want the full report.\nWe want it now,' said Rep.

associates, including members of the president\u2019s family.\nThe Justice Department said the report was delivered by a security officer Friday afternoon to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and then it went to Barr.\nWord of the delivery triggered reactions across Washington, including Democrats\u2019 demands that it be quickly released to the public and Republicans\u2019 contentions that it ended two years of wasted time and money.\nThe next step is up to Barr, who is charged with writing his own account of Mueller\u2019s findings and sending it to Congress.\nIn a letter to lawmakers , he declared he was committed to transparency and speed.\nHe said he could provide details as soon as this weekend.\nThe White House sought to keep some distance from the report, saying it had not seen or been briefed on the document.\nTrump, surrounded by advisers and political supporters at his resort in Florida, stayed uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter.\nWith no details

Mueller\u2019s prosecutors.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether Mueller might have referred additional investigations to the Justice Department.\nAll told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies.\nTwenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the Internet.\nFive Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.\nIt\u2019s unclear what steps Mueller might take if he uncovered what he believes to be criminal wrongdoing by Trump, in light of Justice Department legal opinions that have held that sitting presidents may not be indicted.\nIn his letter to lawmakers, Barr noted the Justice Department had not denied any request from the special counsel, something Barr would have been required to disclose to ensure there was

on a balcony to wave at the crowd of more than 600 enjoying cocktails and appetizers by the pool, according to party vice-chairwoman Tami Donnally, who attended the event.\nBarr has said he wants to make as much public as possible, but any efforts to withhold details is sure to prompt a tussle between the Justice Department and lawmakers who may subpoena Mueller and his investigators to testify before Congress.\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-California, threatened a subpoena Friday.\nSuch a move would likely be vigorously contested by the Trump administration.\nThe conclusion of Mueller\u2019s investigation does not remove legal peril for the president .\nTrump faces a separate Justice Department investigation in New York into hush money payments during the campaign to two women who say they had sex with him years before the election.\nHe\u2019s also been implicated in a potential campaign finance violation by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who says Trump asked him to arrange the transactions.\nFederal prosecutors, also in New York, have been investigating foreign contributions made to the president\u2019s inaugural committee.\nNo matter the findings in Mueller\u2019s report, the investigation has already illuminated Russia\u2019s assault on the American political system, painted the Trump campaign as eager to exploit the release of hacked Democratic emails and exposed lies by Trump aides aimed at covering up their Russia-related contacts.\nThe special counsel brought a sweeping indictment accusing Russian military intelligence officers of hacking Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and other Democratic groups during the 2016 campaign.\nHe charged another group of Russians with carrying out a large-scale social media disinformation campaign against the American political process that also sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton.\nMueller also initiated the investigation into Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer, who pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations arising from the hush money payments and in the Mueller probe to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal.\nAnother Trump confidant, Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied about his pursuit of Russian-hacked emails ultimately released by WikiLeaks.\nMueller has also been investigating whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation.\nSince the special counsel\u2019s appointment in May 2017, Trump has increasingly tried to undermine the probe by calling it a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and repeatedly proclaiming there was \u201cNO COLLUSION\u201d with Russia.\nBut one week before Mueller\u2019s appointment, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, later saying he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d at the time.\n", ["Name_Calling-Labeling", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Flag_Waving"]], ["Mueller Is Done, but the Trump Investigations Are Just Heating Up\nThe Russia investigation is over.\nOr is it?\nAttorney General William Barr has notified Congress that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has \u201cconcluded his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters,\u201d as required under Justice Department regulations.\nMueller has submitted to Barr a confidential report of \u201cprosecution or declination decisions he has reached,\u201d and Barr has promised to review the report and advise Congress of Mueller\u2019s \u201cprincipal conclusions\u201d as soon as this weekend.\nBarr further stated that he would determine whether other information can be released to Congress and the public, committing to \u201cas much transparency as possible.\u201d\nSo what comes next?\nIt appears that Mueller and a small staff will close up shop in the near future.\nBut that does not mean that the investigation into President Donald Trump is over.\nDepending on the contents of Mueller\u2019s report, Congress may have some work to do.\nMueller\u2019s original mandate required him to comply with all policies of the Justice Department.\nIt seems likely, then, that he would adhere to the DOJ opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\nIf so, then even if Mueller found evidence of conspiracy between Trump and Russia to defraud the United States by interfering with the fair administration of elections (sometimes referred to as \u201ccollusion\u201d), he would refrain from filing an indictment, and instead provide his findings to members of Congress for them to consider whether impeachment is appropriate.\nIf that is the case, then Congress\u2019s work will just be beginning.\nOther prosecutors may also have more work to do.\nDuring the course of his investigation, Mueller has kept a narrow focus on his own mission and farmed out related cases to at least four U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices.\nThose investigations remain ongoing.\nIt is possible that Mueller has handed off additional investigations in which charges have not yet been filed, and so would be unknown to the public.\nFor example, the investigation of fraud and campaign finance violations against former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was handed off to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York.\nCohen pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to three years in prison, but it appears that work on that case continues.\nEarlier this week, a judge approved the release of redacted search warrants in the Cohen case, permitting prosecutors to keep more than 18 pages of text from public disclosure.\nThe redacted pages appeared under the heading \u201cIllegal Campaign Contribution Scheme.\u201d The court stated that redaction was necessary because \u201cdisclosure would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.\u201d This language suggests that the work of SDNY is far from over.\nSubjects of the investigation could include Donald Trump, Jr., who reportedly signed at least one of the checks that were provided to Cohen as reimbursement for his illegal payments to silence woman from publicly accusing Trump of extramarital affairs .\nReports have indicated that Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization, has received immunity in exchange for his cooperation.\nEven if Mueller\u2019s work is done, the work of the SDNY continues.\nIn addition to SDNY, other U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices are also known to be working on matters that arose from Mueller\u2019s work.\nIn December, the Eastern District of Virginia charged two associates of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with conspiring to act as agents of a foreign government and related charges.\nIn that case, Flynn\u2019s former business partner Bijan Kian and Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim were charged with agreeing to lobby U.S. officials and influence public opinion against Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, an outspoken critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia is handling the pending case against Roger Stone for lying to Congress, making false statements and tampering with witnesses.\nThat case is set for trial in November.\nIf Stone should decide to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others, prosecutors would follow those leads as well.\nIn addition, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the District of Columbia has been handling cases against Sam Patten and Maria Butina , respectively .\nPatten pleaded guilty in August to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and has agreed to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others.\nPatten pleaded guilty to lobbying on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party and concealing his role from the U.S. government.\nPatten further pleaded guilty to illegally using straw purchasers to buy tickets to the Trump inauguration for a Ukrainian oligarch for $50,000.TThe law prohibits inaugural committees from accepting money from foreign nationals.Butina pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to act as an agent of Russia.She has been cooperating with the government.\nIn February, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the District of South Dakota indicted her boyfriend, Republican operative Paul Erickson, on wire fraud and money laundering charges.\nThese cases will continue, as will any cases that they spawn.\nIt may be a long time before the work of Mueller is

Hemingway\nThose who spent the last two years pushing the narrative that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election need to be held accountable, the Federalist senior editor Mollie Hemingway argued Friday.\nEarlier in the day, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in its report on the Russia investigation to the Department of Justice and it was announced that no new indictments would be forthcoming.\nDuring Friday's All-Star panel segment on Fox News' \"Special Report with Bret Baier,\" Hemingway -- along with Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti and Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason -- weighed in on the breaking news that reverberated throughout Washington.\nMUELLER SUBMITS LONG-AWAITED RUSSIA PROBE REPORT TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\nHemingway began by noting that the \u201cRussia narrative\u201d predates the Mueller probe, having begun circulating during the 2016 election after the creation of the infamous Clinton campaign-funded Steele dossier, which pushed the theory that then-Republican candidate Donald Trump was a \u201cRussian agent.\u201d\n\u201cWe have, for the last three years ... frequently [witnessed] hysteria about treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election,\u201d Hemingway told the panel.\n\u201cThe fact [is] that there are no more indictments coming and the fact [is] that all of the indictments that we\u2019ve seen thus far have been for process crimes or things unrelated to what we were told by so many people in the media was \u2018treasonous collusion\u2019 to steal the 2016 election.\u201d\n\u201cIf there is nothing there that matches what we\u2019ve heard from the media for many years, there needs to be a reckoning and the people who spread this theory both inside and outside the government who were not critical and who did not behave appropriately need to be held accountable,\u201d she added.\n\"The people who spread this theory

was \u201ctoo early\u201d to draw major conclusions, he later added that those who attacked Mueller\u2019s credibility throughout his investigation will have to walk back their hostility if he concludes that there was no collusion, including President Trump.\nMeanwhile, Continetti suggested that the Mueller report could be the \u201cgreatest anticlimax in American history,\u201d and that the entire investigation could be \u201cfor nothing\u201d because it was \u201can investigation without a crime.\u201d He did, however, insist that the \u201cbattle will continue\u201d as the White

colleague Tucker Carlson stressed that the investigation had ended with no charges related to 'collusion' between President Donald Trump's campaign and the Russian government, the purported impetus for the probe.\n'This investigation was always, from day one about collusion with Russia, about betraying this country.\nThey told us that for years,' Carlson said.\nCarlson played a highlight reel of Democrats and pundits on other channels previously predicting imminent indictments of Trump and his family members.\nNone were indicted and Mueller reportedly doesn't recommend any further

hadn't been seen yet.\n'To say that somehow this clears the president seems like the height of rushing to judgment,' Wallace said.\nHe dismissed the idea that those prosecuted had been charged with process crimes, saying they were very serious.\nMeanwhile, on CNN, analyst and frequent Trump critic Jeffrey Toobin had an answer to colleagues who warned Trump and his supporters against prematurely

investigation of Democrats and Hillary for colluding with Russia.\nWe know that after laundering their money through the law firm of Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, a foreign intelligence agent named Christopher Steele was employed by the Hillary campaign and DNC to collude with Russian intelligence sources and influence our election.\nSo far as we know, Mueller was not told to investigate only

him was made against author Jerome Corsi unless he signed a \"confession\" he claims was untrue.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's team offered Corsi a proposed plea agreement, which would have required him to admit to one criminal charge with two components: lying to investigators and obstruction of justice before congressional or grand jury proceedings.\nCorsi refused to sign the plea deal.\nHe then released drafts of his plea agreement and indictment, went on a media tour slamming Mueller's team, and published a book detailing his experiences with the special counsel.\nIn the end, Mueller concluded his investigation without ever bringing charges against Corsi.\nOn Friday, Corsi accused Mueller's team of trying to push him to plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit.\n\"I went in there to cooperate with them.\nThey treated me as a criminal,\" Corsi said.\n\"I consider this entire investigation to be fraudulent,\" he said.\n\"I'm glad it's over.\"\nBecause Corsi was never prosecuted, we know that this was a false threat, that there was no substantial case.\nHad Dr. Corsi (he is a Harvard Ph.D. in history) possessed fewer resources (including especially guts), he might well have lied and given the false evidence demanded in order to spare himself the ordeal of prosecution before a District of Columbia jury composed overwhelmingly of Hillary voters, cognizant that federal prosecutors obtain guilty verdicts about 98% of the time.\nI do commend Robert Mueller and his team for not faking enough evidence to obtain a phony indictment, but I still hold them

legal counsel they were forced to hire for the defence of their lives.It is a true life tragedy that Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, who brought all this human suffering about, will never be

intelligence agency by making some of its top brass an active part if it.\nToo bad that the Law of the Land ended up treating Paul Manafort, found guilty of financial crimes\u2014not Russian

unrecognized minority that still exists.\n\u201cWell Whooptidoo, so what?\u201d \u201cI have been chewing nails and spitting rust since this conclusion to the Mueller investigation is being discussed everywhere, on TV, Radio, Newspapers, Internet and probably around the water cooler.\n\u201cBut nowhere have I heard anyone broach some truth, while some are announcing in a celebratory tone that the Mueller Investigation has concluded and he has announced that there will be no indictments for Russian Collusion, no collusion indictments to obstruct justice etc., etc., etc.\n\u201cThe whole conspiracy was started based on afalse dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat party, handed over to the FBI who knew it was a concoction headed by a former British spy, carried to the next step by the FBI in order to obtain FISA warrants that would allow them to surveil the Trump campaign, and perform wire taps that were based on an illegal process, and people are saying Mueller is known to be a very ethical investigator, and we are sure he did a thorough job over the last two years, while in fact he could have concluded the investigation in the first two days based on the fact that it originated from a fake dossier.\nSince the investigation was motivated by a fake document and suspiciously Illegal Warrants, they still went forward based on NOTHING..\n\u201c Count on, dirt-digging, blackmail-ready Democrats and the media continuing to carry on the Hatefest.\nEar-splitting shrieking of the 90%-media supported loony left Thanks to Paul Sperry over at Real Clear Investigations, it was revealed only days before delivery of Mueller\u2019s Special Counsel Report that dirty dossier writer, Christopher Steele is still on the payroll, still out there digging in Hillary\u2019s manure pile.\nThat ought to keep self-serving RINOs like Mitt Romney hiding under their desks straight up through the 2020 election.\nIn the ear-splitting shrieking of the 90%-media supported loony left, the masses should never forget how we got from Nov. 8, 2016 to yesterday.\nThe Establishment refused to believe that life would go on without them\u2014but it did.\nThey plunged the world into an environment of seething hatred, one in which even school children could be attacked for political reasons.\nThose who refuse to believe that life would go on without them also refuse to believe in God\u2019s Will, and will never recognize that it is God Almighty and not politics that rules the world.\nThe Witch Hunt will continue The Witch Hunt

stance?\nEarl Rasmussen: Obviously there are certain elements, mostly in the mainstream media that's been stoking this, and certain members on the Hill, in Congress, that were hoping for something, because we heard over and over again that the next bombshell was coming.\nBut you're correct, there's nothing explosive, and with no new indictments coming out, and really if you look at the indictments that were there, there's nothing related at all to any type of conspiracy or collusion as far as the six people indicted who are US citizens.\nAnd the Russians that are indicted are

a lot of political and perhaps emotional capital was invested in this Mueller probe.\nIs this a bit of an anticlimax?\nEarl Rasmussen: I think for many it is an anticlimax, absolutely.\nThere's so much invested here.\nTwo plus years, millions of dollars, political capital on both sides, and you've got people who have lost their livelihoods.\nA lot of the people that were brought in, their names exposed, their reputations were damaged.\nWe've got the six people that have been charged [for] things that happened ten years ago; some are financially ruined now; some will spend time in jail for lying to Congress or lying to the FBI over minor financial things that may have gone unnoticed without this.\nYou look at the other side too, and we've got damage to international relations, not just with Russia, where what has occurred is just outrageous, but also Europe.\nI mean we forced Europe to follow through on sanctions that there's no evidence for.\nThey've lost business as a result of that, so I'm sure the Europeans will be quite interested in seeing more and learning more about what's coming out of this as well.\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Evan Vucci Trump Again Supports Idea of Making

Press)\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 With the long-awaited special counsel\u2019s investigation finished but its contents still shrouded in mystery, Americans waited for details, yawned with boredom or stayed fixed to their long-cemented positions on President Donald Trump, the man at the probe\u2019s center.\nFor all the expected splash of Robert Mueller\u2019s report, it arrived with more of a thud, thanks to the secrecy surrounding it.\nFew saw reason to think it would sway many opinions in a divided republic.\nHelen Jones, a 72-year-old retired English professor in Salt Lake City, Utah, who is Republican but despises Trump, knows whatever comes out, her relatives who strongly back the president won\u2019t budge \u2014 just as detractors like her won\u2019t be convinced he isn\u2019t a

should even be discussing,\u201d she said.\nMueller worked in virtual silence as a stream of charges have flowed forth against 37 people and companies.\nFrom the start, with his appointment on May 17, 2017, some have framed his work as a battle of good and evil of biblical proportions.\nAnd on the 675th day, Mueller finished his work, and he rested.\nBut nothing immediately changed for those who had watched with bated breath.\nFor Mark Itzen, a 64-year-old social worker from Levittown, Pennsylvania, it was a frustrating reality.\n\u201cThe most disturbing thing for me is that we don\u2019t know the details,\u201d the Democrat said.\n\u201cI thought we have the right to know right off the bat after all this anticipation.\u201d\nExpectations remained high for some sort of explosive

justice that aligns with their view of Trump as Antichrist, it seemed the endless billows of smoke would surely produce evidence of fire.\nFor conservatives who subscribed to the president\u2019s view of the probe as a witch hunt and dismissed it as the misguided tomfoolery of a bitter opposition whose search for retribution is as loopy as its policies, it seemed certain to bring exoneration to Trump and maybe even a roadmap for future victory by him and his party.\nJason Cox, a 51-year-old farmer in Campbellsville, Kentucky, who voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to again next year, saw it the way Trump framed it \u2014 as a witch hunt.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t turn out, it seems to me, the way Democrats wanted,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think Pelosi and Schumer are going to just keep

said the report won\u2019t bring a quick end to anything.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the report will be issued and everybody says, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done now,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is all part of a process.\nThe process will work its way out.\nThis is why our country has stood the test of time.\u201d\nShaela and Cindy Buchanan were tackling chores Saturday morning at the Lost Sock

sees Trump as \u201cbought and paid for\u201d while regular people live paycheck to paycheck.\nShe doubts Mueller\u2019s report ultimately does anything to change that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel it is

Washington insiders, the waiting game isn't easy.\nSpeculation about the hotly anticipated report's contents has been rampant.\nStill, in a show of confidence, President Trump waved and flashed two thumbs up to supporters as he returned to his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday.\nThe president's demeanor signaled the administration's strong belief that Mueller's long-awaited final report contained good news.\nAmong other things, the special counsel is not recommending any further indictments as part of his inquiry, which effectively ended Friday, according to a senior Justice Department official.\nFurther, Mueller did not charge any Americans with illegally conspiring with Russians on any matter, including election interference -- a foundational reason for the launch of the high-profile Mueller probe nearly two years ago.\nEven as Trump remained in Florida, Barr was working \"hand in hand\" on Saturday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in reviewing the Mueller report at the DOJ, the senior official said.\nFox News is told that Barr may run the conclusions past White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Emmett Flood, who were in Mar-a-Lago, before they are released -- but that Trump's personal attorneys are unlikely to be notified.\nIt will likely take longer for the facts supporting the conclusions to come out, Fox News is told, because there may be materials that are either classified, or subject to executive privilege in the factual material.\nWATCH THE MEDIA MELTDOWN: RACHEL MADDOW BECOMES VISIBLY EMOTIONAL AFTER MUELLER REPORT DROPPED, WITH NO NEW INDICTMENTS\nBarr notified key congressional leaders in a letter Friday evening that Mueller finished his investigation, adding that a summary of the probe\u2019s findings may be provided to lawmakers as soon as this weekend.\nFox News has also confirmed that House Democrats, meanwhile, began a conference call at approximately 3:10 p.m.E.T.\nSaturday with \u201cchairs of relevant committees\u201d discussing next steps regarding the Mueller report and messaging.\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will host as Caucus Chair, and attendees will include Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings, and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff, as well as Committee on Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters.\nAt the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for a public release of the Mueller report, and said she would reject any classified briefing of the report's findings to lawmakers.\nAny briefing must be unclassified so that members of Congress can talk about it publicly, Pelosi said.\nDelaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told Fox News on Saturday: \"It\u2019s the end of the beginning.\nBut it\u2019s not the beginning of the end.\"\nHe added: \"We\u2019re spending the weekend in anticipation of what Attorney General Barr may share with Congress,\" and cautioned that Democrats were \"concerned executive privilege could be asserted broadly here\" to hide the report's key findings.\nIn a Saturday conference call, Coons also issued a warning for his fellow Democrats, many of whom have pinned astronomical political hopes on Mueller's findings: \"Once we get the principal conclusions of the report, I think it's entirely possible that that will be a good day for the president and his core supporters.\"\nCHAFFETZ: HYPOCRITICAL DEMS SUDDENLY CARE ABOUT TRANSPARENCY\nSome advocacy groups have made clear they aren't keen on waiting.\nA nonprofit organization on Friday night filed the first known Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit seeking the immediate and total public disclosure of Mueller's completed report and all related documents, echoing bipartisan calls for transparency following his nearly two-year probe into whether the Trump campaign illegally colluded with Russia.\nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) wrote in an emergency complaint filed in a Washington, D.C., federal district court that the \"public has a right to know the full scope of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election and whether the president of the United States played any role in such interference.\"\nThe delivery of the Mueller report, which a DOJ official called \"comprehensive,\" does mean the investigation has concluded without any public charges of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Russia or of obstruction by the president.\nThat's good news for a handful of Trump associates and family members dogged by speculation of possible wrongdoing.\nThey include Donald Trump Jr., who had a role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting at the height of the 2016 election campaign with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was interviewed at least twice by Mueller's prosecutors.\nStill, some key details remain unanswered, EPIC said, prompting its litigation.\nHouse Democrats, meanwhile, have somewhat downplayed the Mueller probe and suggested that the left-leaning lawmakers themselves might take on the job of trying to prove collusion, not ruling out the possibility of Mueller being asked or subpoenaed to testify before congressional committees.\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\u201cIf the Justice Department doesn't release the whole report or tries to keep parts of it secret, we will certainly subpoena the parts of the report and we will reserve the right to call Mueller to testify before the committee or to subpoena him,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.\nWhile the Mueller probe\u2019s conclusions are not yet known, the investigation already has led to indictments, convictions or guilty pleas for nearly three dozen people and three companies.\nAll told, Mueller charged 34 people, including the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort; his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn; and three Russian companies.\nTwenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet.\nFive Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges that he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.\nOPINION: WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD REJECT THE MUELLER REPORT\nDespite all that prosecutorial activity, though, Americans were not implicated in criminally colluding with Russia to influence the election.\nIn a series of posts on Twitter on Friday, journalist Glenn Greenwald -- who also called for the release of the Mueller report -- repeatedly emphasized that point, and condemned pundits for hyping the Mueller report irresponsibly for nearly two years.\n\"It's truly fascinating to watch Dems grapple with the fact that Mueller finished his work without indicting a single American for conspiring with Russia over the election: everything from \"nobody has read his report!\"\n(irrelevant to that fact) to 'sealed indictments!'\n(unhinged).\"\nGreenwald wrote.\nIn another post, he criticized media outlets for promoting the anti-Trump rhetoric of partisan commentators like ex-CIA Director John Brennan -- an Obama appointee whose security clearance was revoked last year because, the Trump administration said, he was using it to lend credence to political attacks.\n\"You can't blame MSNBC viewers for being confused,\" Greenwald continued.\n\"They largely kept dissenters from their Trump/Russia spy tale off the air for 2 years.\nAs recently as 2 weeks ago, they had @JohnBrennan strongly suggesting Mueller would indict Trump family members on collusion as his last act.\n... Oh gosh - turns out that if you hire ex-CIA Directors to be 'news analysts,' they'll abuse our airwaves to disseminate self-serving disinformation.\"\nHe concluded: \"How - if you're an MSNBC viewer (or consumer of similar online content) - can you not be angry & disoriented having been fed utter [bulls--t] like this for 2 straight years with basically no dissent allowed?\nJust listen to what they were telling you to believe & how false it was.\"\nJEROME CORSI CELEBRATES END OF RUSSIA PROBE, SAYS HE'S VINDICATED IN DECISION TO RESIST MUELLER BULLYING\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declared it \"imperative\" to make the full report public, a call echoed by several Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020.\n\"The American people have a right to the truth,\" Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement.\nDemocrats also expressed concern that Trump would try to get a \"sneak preview\" of the findings.\n\"The White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,\" they said in a joint statement.\nIt was not clear whether Trump would have early access to Mueller's findings.\nSpokeswoman Sarah Sanders suggested the White House would not interfere, saying, \"We look forward to the process taking its course.\"\nBut Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Associated Press Friday that the legal team would seek to get \"an early look\" before they were made public.\nGiuliani said it was \"appropriate\" for the White House to be able \"to review matters of executive privilege.\"\nHe said had received no assurances from the Department of Justice on that front.\nHe later softened his stance, saying the decision was \"up to DOJ and we are confident it will be handled properly.\"\nThe White House did receive a brief heads-up on the report's arrival Friday.\nBarr's chief of staff called White House Counsel Emmet Flood Friday about 20 minutes before sending the letter went to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees.\nFox News' Ed Henry, Mike Emanuel, Brooke Singman, Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n", ["Appeal_to_Popularity", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Dem Rep.

The jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison.\nSteinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015. The bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier.\nGarcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident \u2014 they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.\nLead attorney Matt Gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a SIG Sauer with a \"hair trigger in single-action mode\" \u2014 a model well-known for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters. Gonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver.\nProsecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger. They said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene.\nBeyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle.\nAt the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s.\nHe faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge.\nSan Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015. Due to San Francisco's policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities \u2014 which some refer to as a \"sanctuary\" policy \u2014 the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia Zarate.\nAs a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies. The DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody. San Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies.\n\"This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE as we requested, instead of releasing him back onto the streets,\" ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement on Thursday. \"It is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of Americans with sanctuary policies while ignoring the harm inflicted on their constituents.\"\nBut ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody. The agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.\nThough the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding. San Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights.\nGarcia Zarate's deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners, who argued that Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails.\nPresident Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of \"Illegal Immigration.\" Trump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against \"sanctuary cities.\"\nEarly on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration.\n\"The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!\" Trump tweeted.\nIn fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting \u2014 his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry. Lax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration.\nIn contrast, Steinle's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and \"sanctuary\" policies. They have both condemned Trump for \"sensationalizing\" Steinle's death to advance anti-immigration policies, and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials, who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["U.S. judge frees Indonesian immigrant held by Trump order\nA U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration\u2019s order to deport them.\nSPONSORED\nRombot, part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998, learned of the policy change when he appeared for an Aug. 1 check-in with ICE and was arrested.\n\u201cHe walks out of the courthouse right now,\u201d Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said after concluding that Rombot\u2019s detention violated his rights.\nHe walked out of the U.S. District Court in Boston in his blue jail scrubs, without a chance to change into street clothes.

Even though not everything that\u2019s gone wrong is Trump\u2019s fault, he has managed to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to fill the empty seat on the court. It\u2019s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more than a year and a half into his administration. \nTo begin with, Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. That included an unusually central role for the Federalist Society\u2019s Leonard Leo.\nThat wasn\u2019t entirely a Trump mistake. His decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by Leo reflected the reality-TV star\u2019s weakness as a presidential candidate. The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure them, he publicly committed to their top goal. In some ways, that\u2019s successful coalition-building, and what he\u2019s done in office is just keeping his promises on judges.\nStill, it\u2019s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives; it\u2019s another to turn the whole process over to them. We don\u2019t know to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump\u2019s choice and to what extent he was manipulated into choosing him. We have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated by those around him, and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump\u2019s biases: The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump\u2019s cut-of-his-jib test by looking the part. 1\nEither way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the point of view of good presidenting. The judge was certain to be a highly controversial selection from the start. After all, he had been a highly controversial selection for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four Democratic votes after a long delay. Kavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative, a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations. Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background, was bound to stir up trouble. It was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh\u2019s record, especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more. Senate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn\u2019t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points. 2\nSometimes it\u2019s worth taking risks. Presidents who shy away from anything that\u2019s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities. It\u2019s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option. 3\nWhen serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate. It\u2019s still not clear that Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is doomed, but it\u2019s certainly in severe trouble. Losing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts. But there\u2019s an art to minimizing damage. And Trump hasn\u2019t learned it yet.\nFor one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied. Whether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn\u2019t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing. \nIt\u2019s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh. If the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s behavior has been as erratic as ever. First he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward. He sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview. The White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn\u2019t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can\u2019t shoot straight and that he\u2019s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.\nA botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative. And, for that matter, they\u2019ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there\u2019s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal. Trump\u2019s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts. As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president. Trump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.\nAnd yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately. It's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like, which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting, would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors.\nI've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind. I still think that's true. But it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular -- most people, and the entire press corps, love transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadn't been initially disclosed. In the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.\nSome have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court. Perhaps. There are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges, and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers. And if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway. So, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison cannot be substantiated, Dems' lawyer says\nA lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says she is unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison because the lawmaker\u2019s ex-girlfriend refused to provide video of the incident - but the findings are still being turned over to law enforcement.\nThe Associated Press on Monday reported that it obtained a draft of a report written by Susan Ellingstad, a lawyer hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to investigate the claim against Ellison.\n\"The investigation report, which was released today without our knowledge by someone outside of our organization, was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse made by Ms. Monahan,\u201d DFL Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.\nMartin said they planned to turn over the report to local law enforcement.\n\u201cFor the purpose of objectivity and getting all of the facts regarding these allegations, we have decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities in order to let them review the contents and determine whether further investigation is warranted,\u201d Martin said.\nThe Democratic congressman, who serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has denied the allegations.\nIn a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for conducting a \"thorough, independent, and fair review.\"\n\"I believe women who come forward must be heard, and to have their allegations fully investigated,\" Ellison said. \"This is why I have complied with this investigation fully, and will do so with any other inquiries. ... At this time, I will be focusing on the issues of this important election.\"\nEllison\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged in August that Ellison dragged her off a bed by her feet while screaming obscenities at her in 2016. Monahan said she had video footage of the incident and levied the allegation just days ahead of a crowded Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general that Ellison went on to win.\nThe state's Democratic party launched an investigation into the claim, retaining a local attorney with links to the state party to determine whether the alleged incident took place. Democratic party chairman Ken Martin said last week he expected the investigation to conclude soon.\nA draft report obtained by the AP noted Monahan's shifting rationale for refusing to produce the video footage, including that it was lost, was on a USB drive in storage and would be too embarrassing and traumatic to release it.\nThe Ellison accusations have put Democrats in an uncomfortable position, as they speak out on sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh denies the accusations.\nMonahan slammed the Democratic Party for its response to her allegations when compared to its treatment of Christine Blasey Ford. Ford has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to force himself onto her during a high school party nearly four decades ago. Many prominent Democrats have supported Ford\u2019s allegations.\n\u201cNo, they don't,\u201d Monahan tweeted in response to a question of whether the party believes women\u2019s stories. \u201cI've been smeared, threatened, isolated from my own party. I provided medical records from 2017, stating on two different Dr. Visits, I told them about the abuse and who did it. My therapist released records stating I have been dealing and healing from the abuse.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cFour people, including my supervisor at the time, stated that I came to them after and shared the exact story I shared publicly, I shared multiple text between me and Keith, where I discuss the abuse with him and much more. As I said before, I knew I wouldn't be believed.\u201d\nMany other Democrats and progressives \u2013 who largely stayed silent after the accusations against Ellison emerged \u2013 came out in support of Ford, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.\nMonahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics. \u201cI have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story. People can believe it or not. I don\u2019t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,\u201d she wrote in another tweet.\n\u201cThe fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,\u201d she added. \u201cDo you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics? No, we & are families are trying to heal.\u201d\n", ["Loaded_Language"]], ["Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order\nIntelligence agencies were scrambling Tuesday to comply with a sweeping order by President Trump to declassify key documents that could shed light on the origins of the Russia collusion probe that has hamstrung the administration for more than 18 months.\nThe documents Trump ordered declassified involve a renewed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page and text messages from disgraced former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\nThe president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department \u201c[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,\u201d according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\nIt is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents.\n\u201cWhen the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America\u2019s national security interests,\u201d a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cThe Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President\u2019s order.\u201d\nODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was \u201cworking expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.\u201d\nThe documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.\nThe 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format. The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\nThe president also ordered the release of unredacted text messages from fired FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, former FBI counsel Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\nThe president for months has blasted Strzok and Page for the bias revealed in their text messages, as well as Comey and McCabe for their leadership of the FBI. Comey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month.\nA source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\nThe source added that the Justice Department is working on a \"compressed timeline\" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner. The text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are touting the president\u2019s order, saying it covers \u201cpretty much everything that he wanted\u2026and the text messages are a bonus,\u201d a source said of Nunes.\nCongressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.\nBut Democrats,including the committee\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are blasting the declassification order as a \u201cclear abuse of power.\u201d\n\"[Trump] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,\" Schiff said. \"With respect to some of these materials, I have been previously informed by the FBI and Justice Department that they would consider their release a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods.\n\"This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self-interest,\" Schiff added.\nThe president\u2019s order is similar to his February move, when he cleared the way for the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee to release a partisan memo about the surveillance warrant on Carter Page. Democrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Trump's North Korean gamble ends with 'special bond' with Kim\nNearly five hours of unprecedented and surreal talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un culminated on Tuesday with fulsome declarations of a new friendship but just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament.\nFor Trump, that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom's despotic leader. But there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea.\nWhether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday's summit won't be known for years, if not decades. But the dramatic act of extending his hand to one of America's longtime adversaries will forever illustrate Trump's gut-driven, norm-shattering tenure.\n\"We both want to do something. We both are going to do something. And we have developed a very special bond,\" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit. \"People are going to be very impressed. People are going to be very happy.\"\nThe document he and Kim signed said the North Korean leader \"reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" In exchange, Trump agreed to \"provide security guarantees\" to North Korea. \nBut there was no mentioning the previous US aim of \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\" And Kim's commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries' border.\nTrump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected. But he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages.\n\"We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,\" he said.\nMore critical, in Trump's telling, was the development of a personal bond with Kim, a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one American, Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the US in a coma only to die days later.\n\"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,\" Trump said during the summit.\nLater, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier's death contributed to the summit taking place.\n\"Without Otto, this would not have happened,\" Trump said.\nTrump and Kim -- both intent on making history -- greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of US and North Korean flags, a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries' acrimonious relationship.\nTrump's threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize. Instead he predicted he could \"solve a big problem, a big dilemma\" alongside his new partner.\n\"Working together, we'll get it taken care of,\" Trump said.\nThe remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago. The unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality. In a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served H\u00e4agen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert.\nOther unforeseen events also surrounded the summit, increasing the drama. Minutes before the historic handshake, Trump tweeted that his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had suffered a heart attack. Immediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo.\nEven Kim seemed to acknowledge the surreality of the day.\n\"Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,\" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade.\nAt the conclusion of the summit, Trump hailed the talks as a historic, and personal, achievement.\n\"We learned a lot about each other and our countries,\" Trump said. \"I learned he's a very talented man.\"\nWhen pressed about those comments in light of Kim's brutal tactics, Trump continued praising the North Korean leaders' ability to run a country at a young age.\n\"He is very talented,\" Trump said, citing Kim's ability to \"take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough.\"\nKim assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il, also a brutal dictator, died in 2011.\nThroughout the day, Trump and Kim's body language was openly friendly, a striking warmth given Kim's iron grip on power and dismal record on human rights. Trump's move to meet him attracted fierce criticism for normalizing a regime routinely called out for its human rights abuses, that over years has built an image of fearsome renegade regime, throwing around threats of nuclear war.\nThe day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean's shoulder as they walked into their first meeting. Later they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch.\nTrump told reporters he would \"absolutely\" extend an invitation to the White House to Kim, who also heralded a new era.\n\"Today, we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,\" Kim said through a translator. \"The world will see a major change.\"\nThe meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war. By contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the \"war games,\" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative.\nTrump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said \"that's not part of the equation right now.\"\n\"I want to get our soldiers out. I want to bring our soldiers back home,\" Trump said. \"But that's not part of the equation right now. I hope it will be eventually.\"\nTuesday's meeting, convened at a luxury hotel on the island of Sentosa, came just three months after Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for talks on the spot. It was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit, which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between Washington and Pyongyang.\nThe talks were quickly revived, leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded Tuesday.\nAfter the men shook hands, they repaired inside for one-on-one talks. In that first meeting they were joined only by translators, a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for high-stakes huddles.\nLater in the day, advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch.\nTrump took keen interest in the pageantry of the day, insisting the pictures beamed around the world reflect a commanding leader making a decisive, world-altering move. At the same time, he'd admitted he didn't believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of Kim.\nAs part of the advance work, Trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince Kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment. Trump showed Kim the movie on an iPad during their talks.\nHere in futuristic Singapore, however, Kim was able to view the benefits of economic advancement at close range. He was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the high-end Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the type of glitzy development few North Koreans could ever imagine coming to their country.\nKim was cheered by onlookers who caught sight of the dictator, who until earlier this spring was not believed to have ever left North Korea as supreme leader.\n", ["Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["A popular public school Bible class in West Virginia faces legal challenge\nGym is Trenton Tolliver\u2019s favorite class. But the 7-year-old is also a huge fan of the weekly Bible course at Princeton Primary, his public elementary school. He gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales. Noah and the Ark is a favorite. Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course. And the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel.\n\u201cThat one was a little bit of a surprise,\u201d Trenton said as he sat with his parents, Brett and Courtney Tolliver, one day this month watching his little sister\u2019s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia.\nThis spring, Bible classes such as Trenton\u2019s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County. For decades, the county\u2019s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day \u2014 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school. Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition. The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends. And there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program.\nNow Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge. Two county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution. Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class \u201cadvances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.\u201d\nSupporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief.\n\u201cMy experience with it has been very positive. I\u2019ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,\u201d said the Rev. David W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton. \u201cAny time God\u2019s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing.\u201d\nTrenton\u2019s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great program mainly because it\u2019s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,\u201d said Brett Tolliver, 27. \u201cMore importantly, I don\u2019t know who it harms. The kids aren\u2019t forced to be there.\u201d\nCourtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids love it and the ones who don\u2019t participate aren\u2019t made to feel left out.\u201d\nBut the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program\u2019s popularity shouldn\u2019t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity. The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.\nThe suit quotes from one lesson: \u201cIf all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.\u201d Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time. It says: \u201cSo picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur! He and Eve could have their own personal water slide! Wouldn\u2019t that be so wild!\u201d\nThe district declined a request to observe one of the classes.\nElizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case. Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class. Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren\u2019t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out. Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book.\nBypassing the class left her vulnerable to bullying. Deal said other students told her daughter that she was going to hell. One day a student saw her daughter reading a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d novel and told her, according to the mother: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be reading this. You need to be reading the Bible.\u201d\nEventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class. She pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted.\nDeal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state. \u201cWhen something is wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to stand up against it.\u201d\nGod is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120). A lot of the good jobs in the county have left \u2014 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level \u2014 but the churches have stayed.\nYou can find the Church of God here. And the Church of Christ. And the Church of Jesus. There are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal. The radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock. Billboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation. Beneath a Chick-fil-A billboard in Princeton, another asks: \u201cIf you die tonight. Heaven or Hell?\u201d\nThe Rev. Ray Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades. The church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does. For Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge.\n\u201cThere is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I\u2019ve read almost every piece of history that\u2019s in the Bible has eventually been proven,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.\u201d\nHurt, whose son, the Rev. J.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class. But he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.\n\u201cIf you read the Bible, you\u2019re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to push religion with it. It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.\u201d\nThe idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn\u2019t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools.\n\u201cAs a person of faith myself, I don\u2019t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,\u201d White said. \u201cBut to me this seems a pretty clear violation of the Constitution.\u201d\nWhite holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.\nIn a commentary for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, White wrote that \u201cthe Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies.\u201d\nShe argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn\u2019t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn\u2019t mean they should be taught during the instructional day. She also said it was untrue that children who didn\u2019t take the class weren\u2019t made to \u201cfeel different or ostracized.\u201d\nWhen White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith. \u201cI will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White. God Bless!!\u201d one wrote.\nAnother wrote:\n\u201cLynne White You are not a Christian, a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views.\u201d\nIf it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is. Even the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,\u201d said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Bible, whether it\u2019s Koran, whether it\u2019s Torah, whether it\u2019s some other book. But it should be optional, not enforced. If the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.\u201d\nBut the program\u2019s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts. Instead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield. (Faber was nominated by President George H.W. Bush.)\nRepresenting the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases. Hiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district\u2019s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law. The district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday.\n\u201cThere are two things to look at,\u201d Sasser said. \u201cThe first is whether you can have a Bible course at all. And the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted. It\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very confident on the first issue. And on the second issue ... our client is very, very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law.\u201d\nBut the plaintiffs aren\u2019t looking for flexibility. They want the Bible class out of the school day.\nThe program \u201cis unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,\u201d said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation. \u201cThere is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.\u201d\nAccording to Elliott, the Mercer program is \u201cextremely rare\u201d and there are only a handful of districts around the country with similar courses.\nThe amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from \u201corganizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools\u2019 students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.\u201d\nCharles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn\u2019t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form.\n\u201cThis is a loser for the school district,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.

CNN in turn dropped its lawsuit on the matter, which had ballooned into a test of press freedoms in the Trump era.\nBut while it yielded to Mr. Acosta \u2014 whose testy questions had touched off Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 the administration used the occasion to lay down a set of formal rules governing reporters\u2019 behavior at future White House news conferences, a highly unusual step.\nAmong the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern. \u201cFailure to abide,\u201d the administration warned, \u201cmay result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass.\u201d\nThe White House sought to blame Mr. Acosta for behaving disrespectfully, although Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists and encourages a free-for-all format when taking questions from reporters.\nCodifying the behavior of journalists struck some as an ominous encroachment into freedom of the press, and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said on Monday that it had not been consulted about the new guidelines.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: \u201cThese rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny. The White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.\u201d\nStill, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed. Mr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce \u201cregulations\u201d after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta\u2019s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale.\n\u201cWe would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement.\nPress relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days. President Barack Obama\u2019s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences. Mr. Obama often chastised reporters, including Mr. Acosta on one occasion, for questions he deemed overly aggressive or grandstanding.\nBut Mr. Trump, a devoted news consumer who relishes his coverage, plays up his conflicts with reporters in part to excite his supporters. He has held far fewer formal news conferences than his predecessors, and the daily White House briefing has virtually disappeared on his watch.\nRevoking Mr. Acosta\u2019s White House badge was the most severe step yet, and it soon became apparent that the move would not pass legal muster: After suing last week, Mr. Acosta was granted the temporary return of his credentials by a federal judge.\nA back-and-forth ensued over the weekend. Bill Shine, the deputy chief of staff for communications, sent a letter to Mr. Acosta that listed several reasons that his pass had been revoked, perhaps an attempt to satisfy the judge\u2019s request for a clear rationale. CNN\u2019s lawyers called the note an \u201cafter-the-fact concocted process.\u201d By Monday afternoon, the sides had reached a resolution.\nAides to Mr. Trump say that the president does not mind answering questions, pointing to his numerous impromptu sessions with reporters during White House photo-ops and Marine One departures.

Lawyers for Assange and Manafort denounced the report as false.\nIf confirmed, the report Tuesday would suggest a direct connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which released tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian spies during the 2016 election.

During it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the \u201cpowerful Jews\u201d were his enemies, and that Jews were \u201cresponsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,\u201d as well as other incendiary remarks.\nA religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him. Mr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.\nMuch of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women\u2019s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light. Their reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week.\nWhat is the Nation of Islam?\nThe Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D. Fard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933. It first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization. Encouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.\nEdward E. Curtis IV, the author of \u201cBlack Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,\u201d said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s. But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement\u2019s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X. After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and \u201950s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism. It was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on \u201cthe white man\u201d as \u201cthe white devil\u201d). But in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians. That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism. (Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as \u201ca very great man.\u201d)\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions. The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad. Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is \u201cvirtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,\u201d then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to \u201cmake an example\u201d of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private. Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister\u2019s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the \u201cMillion Man March,\u201d a political and religious revival event in Washington.\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\nOn March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet \u201cmy absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.\u201d A day later, she said that she was \u201ccommitted to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,\u201d but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nIn an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour\u2019s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\n\u201cIn that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,\u201d she said. The essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n\u201cFor those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,\u201d Mr. Curtis said.\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s remarks about Jews \u201cunbelievably vile,\u201d emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January. The News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama\u2019s candidacy.\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite. He reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people \u201csometimes make me shudder.\u201d)\nKatie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: \u201cPresident Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life. That includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan\u2019s views over the years. Today is no different \u2014 he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.\u201d\nRepresentative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an \u201coutstanding human being,\u201d and later said he was not bothered by the leader\u2019s position on \u201cThe Jewish Question.\u201d\nAfter a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that \u201cI reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan\u2019s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.\u201d\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence\nSweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.\nSweden\u2019s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope.\nIn 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million.\nBut Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution.\nFour people were shot dead in the first week of this year.

It\u2019s all a MISTRANSLATION!\nThus, it took more than a year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable \u201cmistranslation\u201d defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website:\nYet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel. It can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one\u2019s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.\nIn other words, the conscience can \u201cinform\u201d a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking \u201cfor now,\u201d given one\u2019s particular \u201climits.\u201d This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.\nBut it\u2019s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr. Dawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary. All of the critics of AL are wrong\u2014every one of them!\u2014because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.\nDr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr. Dawn Goldstein\nHere we go again. So what does the Latin say? Here is the paragraph in the official Latin:\nHaec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.\nYes, and so what? Well, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,\u201d the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering. So, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.\u201d So, it\u2019s an offering to God, not a response to God. Big difference.\nBut just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an \u201coffering\u201d to God? It would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d make obedience to the moral law difficult. And that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: \u201cPope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.\u201d\nSo, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means\u00ae would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according \u201cthe \u201cconcrete complexity of one\u2019s limits,\u201d is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior. Fastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.\nWhat about the English locution \u201cwhile yet not fully the objective ideal,\u201d which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals? Not so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend. Do not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase \u201cobiectivum exemplar,\u201d which, translated literally into English is \u201cobjective exemplar.\u201d They declare triumphantly: \u201cThe Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.\u201d\nGive. Me. A. Break. A pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: \u201c(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal. Likewise, the definition of the English word \u201cexemplar\u201d is simply: \u201can ideal model.\u201d\nHere too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away. For if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely \u201cexemplary\u201d rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men\u2014including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\u2014then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue. Thus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least \u201cfor now\u201d (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an \u201cex\u201d who has \u201cremarried\u201d and is now mired in the \u201cconcrete complexity one\u2019s limits.\u201d\nSo, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven\u2019t consulted the Latin text\u2014including those ignorant Vatican translators. According to their proposed \u201calternate translation\u201d into English, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d is \u201cthe offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\u201d Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.\nIt seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness. Indeed, their \u201cproposed alternate translation\u201d reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to the \u201cperfect objective model.\u201d Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery? Are you perfect? Then again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law. But such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line. And Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green. No problem here! has been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Our dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the \u201coffering\u201d to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d couple with children not to end their relationship, which would be the \u201cperfect objective model,\u201d but rather to \u201clive in continence until they may\u2014after the hoped for declaration of nullity\u2014enter into a true marriage.\u201d That is, they would have Francis affirming John Paul II\u2019s Familiaris consortio, which repeats the Church\u2019s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous \u201csecond marriage,\u201d failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments.\nBut the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in \u201csecond marriages\u201d do not have to live in continence, but rather\u2014in \u201ccertain cases\u201d\u2014may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a \u201cprocess of discernment.\u201d As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them \u201cthere is no other interpretation.\u201d\nMoreover, the Maltese bishops' \u201cguidelines\u201d for implementing AL, published in L\u2019Osservatore Romano\u2014for which Bergoglio thanked them\u2014declare thus:\nIf, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with \u201chumility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God\u2019s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it\u201d (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).\nThis Pope\u2019s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis. See the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.\nShaw maintains that AL can be \u201cbent into some kind of orthodoxy.\u201d Perhaps. But it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope\u2019s statements into conformity with the Faith. Moreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers\u2014while others disagree\u2014has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct. But Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction. Quite to the contrary, confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for \u201ccertain\u201d public adulterers by Bergoglio\u2019s co-conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade, which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL. As Shaw observes of AL: \u201cWhat we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.\u201d\nIn a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy, which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such. But Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy\u2014undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally\u2014without the guilt of an explicit promulgation. In so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ). Honorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine. And yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy. A similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.\nMeanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy. In a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura\u2014the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect. And this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.\nWill this sop buy Burke\u2019s silence, staving off the feared public correction? We will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily. But this move demonstrates\u2014if more evidence were needed\u2014that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants. That the neo-Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Israel Takes On the Shia Crescent\nDespite Israel's repeated warnings, Barack Obama's reckless appeasement of the Iranian regime has enabled its rise as a hegemonic threat in the Middle East region as well as a threat to international peace and security. In 2009, Obama turned his back on millions of dissidents in the streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities, who were peacefully protesting the rigged election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president. In 2011, Obama precipitously removed the remaining U.S. combat troops from Iraq, giving rise to ISIS\u2019s re-emergence in Iraq from its bases in Syria. The radical Shiite Iranian regime purported to come to the \u201crescue\u201d of both countries from the Sunni terrorists, turning Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process. Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression.\nMeanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. This plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran\u2019s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast. This road makes Iran\u2019s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and to equip Iran\u2019s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad. This helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.\n\u201cEverything depends now on the Americans\u2019 willingness to stop this,\u201d said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article. However, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran\u2019s Shiite Crescent expansion. \u201cObama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,\u201d said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,\u201d Tabler added. \u201cIt\u2019s a new monster.\u201d\nFurthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces. And Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers. Despite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah\u2019s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran.\nWhile Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection. Just recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles. Israel will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.\nHowever, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran\u2019s larger ambitions. In light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy. \u201cTheir overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,\u201d wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy. As long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran\u2019s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, \u201cIsrael is determined to continue addressing it on its own.\u201d\nAt least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran\u2019s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond. President Trump\u2019s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration\u2019s milquetoast approach to Iran.\nAs the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said that the \u201cso called liberation of areas by Assad\u2019s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.\u201d He claimed that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cobjectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,\u201d without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives.\nWhether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen. In the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran\u2019s ambitions in Syria itself.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language"]], ["\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be a set-up\u201d: Neighbor of Las Vegas Shooter Claims He Didn\u2019t Do It\nThis report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com\nA caller to the Michael Savage radio show who says he was neighbors with Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock asserts that Paddock could not have carried out the massacre and that it was actually a \u201cset-up\u201d.\nThe man, a former Marine who called himself Rick, says he was Paddock\u2019s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite, Nevada.\n\u201cI can tell you 100% this is not that kind of guy,\u201d said Rick, adding that he would see Paddock every other day and that the two would go to a local bar and play slot machines.\n\u201cHe never even told me that he owned a gun,\u201d continued the shooter\u2019s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big conspiracy theory guy, but it don\u2019t sit right,\u201d said Rick, before making the extraordinary claim that the whole shooting was a \u201cset up\u201d and that Paddock\u2019s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting.\nThe caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a \u201clone wolf\u201d attack.\nAs a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from.\nRick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office to relay all the information he knew.\nAlthough the claims are intriguing, it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting, friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors, with some outright denying it to be possible.\nIf Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors.\nHowever, the neighbor\u2019s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting.\nWhat do you think?

But it\u2019s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History\u2019s headquarters. AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History. And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.\nDuring the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a \u201cJVP Academic Advisory Board Member.\u201d But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.\nThe Balfour event was not AJHS\u2019 only partnership with JVP. In December, the AJHS will feature \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel. Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council. His goal is to \u201cnormalize Jewish anti-Zionism\u201d. AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission. The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History. Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH. Leo Forchheimer\u2019s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel. What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?\nA third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism.\nEfrat has claimed that, \"Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews. Being Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism.\"\nAJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives. But when it comes to Israel, there\u2019s only one perspective.\n\u201cBalfour\u201d and \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d are to be part of AJHS\u2019 \u201c1917: How One Year Changed the World\u201d. The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration. But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist. The exhibition closes with Fishback\u2019s anti-Israel agenda. And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.\nJVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events. It\u2019s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups. Instead it\u2019s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.\nAnd it\u2019s no mystery why.\nThe AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists. Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council. Open Hillel seeks to \"open\" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.\nBerman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS. She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.\nOther AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.\nWhen we look at what is going on in CJH\u2019s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising. Myers is a symptom of the problem. As is AJHS\u2019s partnership with JVP. A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.\nUnlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century. Its perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic.\nAnd yet it\u2019s inescapable.\nEven as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear. The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding \u201cmoderate\u201d opposing voices into Jewish organizations. Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.\nAnd it will not be satisfied with anything less.\nDuring the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship. Is co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?\nThe anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home. And support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views. Not when JVP is at AJHS.\nWe all have choices to make. Sometimes the choices are murky. Other times they are simple and easy.\nWhen the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy. Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.\nAs the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple. But they will not be any less difficult.\nOpposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends. The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.\nSpeaking out against hate is easiest when it\u2019s weakest. It\u2019s hardest when it\u2019s strongest.\nWhen we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out. We don\u2019t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.\nHistory tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts. It also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.\nThere are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society, for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up. There are lessons here for all of us.\nIf you can\u2019t speak out against the American Jewish Historical Society\u2019s partnership with a hate group linked to a literal blood libels and a speaker who defends Hamas, when will your voice be heard?\n", ["Appeal_to_Popularity", "Repetition", "Conversation_Killer", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Tea With the Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist\nPope Paul VI\u2019s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, \u201cMysterium Fidei,\u201d was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species. Having been raised in Remi de Roo\u2019s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist. The understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock. (Read the full document here. )\nWith the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the Catholic bridge, we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy. Published just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times.\nWho can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen:\nTherefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace.\nBut in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that. The encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point. It was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 unapologetically stated. It came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities. Like C.S. Lewis\u2019s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth.\nSomething that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope\u2019s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:\n\u201cAt the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.\u201d\nIn these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality.\nI remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement\u2026 \u201cBy doing what?!\u201d\nMy acceptance from the reading of this document of the Church\u2019s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on Pope Paul\u2019s gracious and beautiful exposition, and in part on the sheer radical, mad unlikeliness of it. What could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren\u2019t true?\nThe idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I\u2019d ever heard. It shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept. It was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, \u201cjust around the corner\u201d.\nBy the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school. I had been taught, by both word and implication, that everything the Catholic Church had taught before Vatican II was pernicious nonsense. Where it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked.\nWhat led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point. It was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings. While mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: \u201cI could be wrong.\u201d At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked. But stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short. It hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses. In order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn\u2019t come from her enemies.\nThe same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, \u201cDo you have any books about Catholicism? Something official?\u201d The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories. Saints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other. Having no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random.\nThe description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading. But even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I\u2019d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world.\nReading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues. Given what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:\nWhen dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment.\nThis was, remember, 1965, four years before the New Mass was issued and before Cardinal Ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured.\nWho, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:\n[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith. It is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved.\nKeeping Cardinal Ottaviani\u2019s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread\u2026\n\u2026it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the \u201ccommunal\u201d Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ\u2019s presence in this sacrament.\nNor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called \u201ctransignification\u201d and \u201ctransfiguration,\u201d or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Our Lord is no longer present.\n[\u2026]\nAnd therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject.[1]\nThose of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn\u2019t about marriage. It\u2019s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood. The demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction aren\u2019t really looking at the undermining of marriage as their primary goal; they want to get at the Eucharist. We know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second. They are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.\nThis knowledge \u2013 that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ \u2013 can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd. The places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives. The bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses. A case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England. In March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the \u201creality of the Eucharist\u201d could new vocations to the priesthood be found.\n\u201cIn treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist. If the Mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary, then the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood might seem extravagant.\u201d\nIt\u2019s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.\nThe targeting of marriage, through the instruments of creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnel-visioned Cardinal Kasper, is demonically brilliant. It\u2019s a \u201cstitch-up\u201d as the English call it; a fix. You make it a matter of \u201cmercy\u201d (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church. You have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity. And of course, we are seeing it starting already.\nIt\u2019s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever. As if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II/Benedict XVI period out of history. It will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of \u201cconservative\u201d seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung.\nIt is easy to see what is coming next. Once certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule. The few bishops with sufficient spine to stand up to the pressure of both Rome and their own national conferences \u2013 newly empowered with directives to make doctrinal declarations \u2013 will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration. A dark, impenetrable and \u201cirreversible\u201d winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall.\nNot being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual \u201ctime bombs,\u201d ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors. I haven\u2019t looked it up. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it\u2019s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption. And I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of \u201cofficial\u201d things. From saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited. But whatever its flaws, Mysterium Fidei is the one I found, and I\u2019m convinced it wasn\u2019t an accident.\nO God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty. In this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time. For me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.\n____________________\n[1] The fact that four years before the New Mass was issued, Paul VI was pinpointing in such detail exactly what Bugnini and co. were preparing makes it all but impossible to escape the conclusion that he knew perfectly well what was coming but approved the disastrous New Rite anyway.

From shooter Paddock\u2019s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.\nIn the last 24 hours the Sheriff\u2019s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.\nOriginally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.\nAs it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.\nAs part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn\u2019t know a hotel security guard had been shot \u201cuntil they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,\u201d Lombardo said. The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor. Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said. Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor. And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities. What\u2019s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre. The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw \u201cmultiple gunmen.\u201d The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre\nAs of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:\nThe new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:\nWhat happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren\u2019t the police rushing to the scene immediately?\nWhy did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?\nPaddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes. Police didn\u2019t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped \u2013 which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.\nMoreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor? Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?\nAccording to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:\nLatest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don\u2019t know why he stopped shooting. @drawandstrike theory looking plausiblehttps://t.co/CQF3MZLHaN \u2014 Mr Alex ???

This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS. Mr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the \u201cgenerous response\u201d offered to God is a sin. This, though, is not what AL is saying. The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God. I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:\nPosted on LifeSiteNews:\nProf. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases. In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that \u201cGod can be \u2018asking\u2019 someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.\u201d Then in a Sept. 28 \u201817 LifeSiteNews article, he states that \u201cthe generous response\u201d owed to God is \u201ca certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.\u201d Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains \u201cthis conscience\u201d in AL 303, this proves that the \u201cgenerous offering owed to God\u201d is the recognition that one is living \u201ccontrary to \u201cthe universal command of the Gospel.\u201d\nProf. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience\u2019s recognition that \u201ca given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel\u201d and this same conscience\u2019s subsequent recognition of a \u201cgenerous response owed to God in the present circumstances.\u201d The subject \u201cconscience\u201d might be the same but the object is different. The \u201cgenerous response\u201d is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\nWhat might be this \u201cgenerous response?\u201d Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he\u2019s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience. Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely. In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil \u201cmarriage\u201d recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence. We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that \u201cthe generous response\u201d could be the ending of a particular sin. Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state. It\u2019s really just the opposite. AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin. Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says \u201ca small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.\u2019\u201d\nIn a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: \u201cImagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves. He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work. The father is happy. Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick? No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.\u201d\nThis is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303. God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel. God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction\u2014even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will. This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law. It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 9 hours ago\nI certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later. I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia. Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.\nWith all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a \u201cmove away from sin\u201d is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical. What constitutes a \u201cmove away\u201d from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin? No example is provided in AL because none can be. The notion is nonsensical. Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi\u2019s claim that by \u201ca move away from sin\u201d in the case of a divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children. But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself. Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church\u2019s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.\nAt any rate, the \u201cbrother and sister\u201d approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis. As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while \u201cdiscerning\u201d their situation, this \u201cdiscernment\u201d being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church. Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d people who believe themselves to be \u201cat peace with God.\u201d And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, \u201cthere is no other interpretation.\u201d\nNo amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience \u201cwithout exception\u201d---is being overthrown in place after place.\nIt is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL. A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.\nRobert Fastiggi to Chris Ferrara \u2022 2 hours ago\nThank you for your response. You write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303. I can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind.\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 16 minutes ago\nTell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing.\nIrony of ironies, the latter-day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion---while Francis does nothing but approve.\nI think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind, but above all with open eyes, for you have clearly shut them to what is going in the dioceses in the name of AL.\nFastiggi\u2019s exchange with Ferrara concerning \u201cMore Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.\u201d\nRobert Fastiggi \u2022 12 hours ago\nI would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa. I give him credit for his colorful style. Unfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis \u201cwishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.\u201d\nHe mentions the Holy Father's letter to the Buenos Aires bishops, but he fails to take into account that the statement of those Argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way, as Cardinal M\u00fcller told Edward Pentin in a Sept. 28 interview published in the National Catholic Register. In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of \u201caccess to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.\u201d This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.\nThe same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara. Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public. I have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases. Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession. With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis. Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks. This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations. As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence. As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.\nBeyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church. He says that Dr. Goldstein and I are \u201cfoot soldiers of a Leviathan Church\u201d because we defend the Roman Pontiff. Does Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a \u201cLeviathan Church\u201d and not the Catholic Church? If this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him. This, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751. I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the \u201cLeviathan Church\u201d under Pope Francis. A more simple question to him would be this: \u201cAre you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?\u201d\nI apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words. I believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a \u201cLeviathan Church\u201d distinct from \u201cthe dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.\u201d\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 9 hours ago\nIf Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina\u2014then I cannot help him.\nAs for my metaphorical reference to a \u201cLeviathan Church,\u201d I am afraid Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal-mindedness. To make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes\u2019s Leviathan. I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists. That it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.\nDr. Fastiggi\u2019s inapt citation to Canon 751 and his clumsy and insulting questions about my \u201cstanding in the Catholic Church\u201d and whether I am \u201crefusing submission to the Roman Pontiff\u201d demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics, and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse. Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly \u201crefusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,\u201d who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to \u201csubmit\u201d to anything via AL.\nI respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi\u2019s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public.\nEditor\u2019s Note: Paragraph breaks added for readability.\n", ["Conversation_Killer", "Straw_Man", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Security Guard Jesus Campos Shot During The Vegas Massacre Raises New Questions About Official Narrative\nThe infamous security guard at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, who was allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such. Jesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery.\nSo who is Jesus Campos?\nThat burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there\u2019s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we\u2019ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room.\nThe ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard.\nAt first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock\u2019s room on the 32nd floor.\nPolice said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock\u2019s assault on concertgoers\u2014potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.\nBut now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught.\nPolice have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response. But the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started. Did Campos call 911? What happened during those six minutes? Much of Campos\u2019s story and background remains a mystery. \u2013Newsweek\nCampos\u2019s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he\u2019d been shot while on \u201crandom patrol\u201d and it could have been anyone of us.\n\u201cFunds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s online petition says. \u201cThis is a young man that I work with day in and day out.

Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.\nA maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor. As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.\nPolice have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up \u2013 so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable?\nAnd still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically.\nWhat exactly do they want us to believe?\nArticle posted with permission from SHTFPlan\n", ["Doubt"]], ["Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre\nIn yet another astonishing eyewitness report that contradicts the official story surrounding the worst mass shooting in American history, a married couple who were celebrating their 10th anniversary in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting have come forward to reveal that there was an active shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel around the same time that supposed lone gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead.\nDuring the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby.\nJeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack.\n\u201cFirst of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night.

The initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock\u2019s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel. Paddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived. That was Version No. 1.\nSome days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him. That raised a number of question, including why no one called 911 after what must have been a loud volley of shots in a hotel hallway. That was Version No. 2.\nBut now that is disputed, in Version No. 3. WaPo reports:\nLas Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week\u2026. The confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said. Lombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman\u2019s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended. MGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said\u2026. Lombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m. This six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments. Police said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing. MGM, though, said it was \u201cconfident\u201d that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and \u201cwas derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.\u201d The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor. On Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company\u2019s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier \u201cwasn\u2019t inaccurate when I provided it.\u201d Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log. Upon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m. The guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock \u201cin close proximity to\u201d 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued. Clear, right? Not so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock\u2019s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below? Las Vegas police say they didn\u2019t get to the floor until after the shooting was over. But MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot. The discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught\u2026. \u2026 on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and \u201cimmediately responded.\u201d MGM said that \u201cMetro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio. These Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.\u201d The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, \u201cI agree with the statement.\u201d These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories.

President Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known. The JCPOA\u2019s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran\u2019s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted. Obama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA. Instead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump\u2019s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of \u201clying to the American people.\u201d It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal. The Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections. Moreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review. Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved. Congress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised. Congress should also consider whether time limits on Iran\u2019s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran\u2019s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea. It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles. This turned out to be a lie. After the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles. The Obama administration\u2019s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA. The new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply \u201ccalls upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped out\u201d emblazoned on the sides. The commander of Iran\u2019s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them. This is not a breach of the JCPOA.\u201d\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution. \u201cA call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,\u201d the Russian ambassador said. In short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal\u2019s terms then still being negotiated, \u201cyou will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\" Rhodes claimed that \u201cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it. So if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.\u201d This was another lie. After the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations. \u201cWe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran\u2019s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor. Iran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own. IAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites. The IAEA\u2019s explanation for not visiting any of Iran\u2019s known military sites is that it had \u201cno reason to ask\u201d for access. Evidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA\u2019s finalization in 2015. The IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.\n\u201cNobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati. Intimidation works. The IAEA knows not to ask.\nAs to the JCPOA\u2019s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too. Kerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA \u201cnever sunsets. There\u2019s no sunset in this agreement.\u201d\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words. He claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a \u201cmisnomer,\u201d before then defending the JCPOA\u2019s time limits. \"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran\u2019s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,\u201d Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month. In other words, let\u2019s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits. In the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry. Kerry declared, \u201c15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.\u201d\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at its inception. Instead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of na\u00efve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is precisely because North Korea\u2019s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.\nAmerica\u2019s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met. British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation. They said that the nuclear deal with Iran was \u201cthe culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes. Therefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.\u201d\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history. Appeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy"]], ["Madagascar Plague Outbreak Has Already Killed 57 And Infected Over 600\nAn outbreak of the plague in Madagascar is spreading at an unprecedented rate. With the ease of spreading the plague, the likelihood that this disease will move to other more densely populated regions of the planet has become a huge concern for many.\nSo far, the plague has claimed 57 lives and infected more than 680 others. These figures are from October 12, however, and the disease is spreading rapidly. An estimated 329 of these cases and 25 of the deaths were in the capital city of Antananarivo. Of the 684 cases reported as of October 12, 474 were the pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and 1 septicemic plague. A further 54 were unspecified, according to the World Health Organization. Of Madagascar\u2019s 114 districts, 35 have reported cases of plague, including at least 10 cities.\nPlague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats. The bacteria will eventually end up causing the often fatal plague. Symptoms can include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called buboes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing. Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form of the disease characterized by a severe lung infection. The infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing. The incubation period is extremely short too, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours of contracting the bacteria making cures in underdeveloped regions of the globe difficult at best.\nAccording to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) in Madagascar. They include probable and suspected cases as well those that have been confirmed by laboratory tests. And while the country experiences regular outbreaks, with an estimated 400 cases of plague each year, this time things are very different, experts warn.\nThis year, health officials report the infections started much earlier than usual, and they\u2019re occurring in new areas, including urban settings. They\u2019ve also seen an unexpected number of cases of pneumonic plague, which transmits more easily from person to person. Historically dubbed the \u201cblack death\u201d the bubonic plague has been responsible for several worldwide pandemics in the past.\nEarly detection of the plague is key since both forms of it can be cured with antibiotics. But, occasionally there can be cases of septicemic plague, where the infection has spread to a person\u2019s bloodstream and can cause bleeding and necrosis of tissue, turning it black.\nInternationally, this outbreak is also being taken seriously. WHO delivered more than 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released $1.5 million in emergency funds earlier this month. The Red Cross has released more than $1 million to deploy a treatment center and has mobilized more than 1,000 volunteers and is upgrading their skills on community surveillance, finding and monitoring people who have been in contact with infected patients and insightful messaging to stop the spread of this disease.\n", ["Name_Calling-Labeling", "Appeal_to_Popularity", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice"]], ["The Las Vegas Security Guard Credited With Finding Shooter, Mysteriously Vanished Into Thin Air\nBy now, we have all heard of Jesus Campos. He\u2019s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock. But the narrative surrounding him has changed wildly since the authorities mentioned him, and now, he\u2019s mysteriously vanished into thin air.\nOf course, this leads many to believe that Campos didn\u2019t even exist, to begin with. His mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas.\nThere are two conflicting timelines of Campos\u2019s injury, but what the media has so far made clear, is that they want the public to believe Campos was walking down the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino\u2019s 32nd floor hallway, when Stephen Paddock spotted him on a camera he\u2019d allegedly set up in a room service cart, just outside his suite. Once he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg. Moments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500.\nBut Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock\u2019s assault. After speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials, Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air.\nDavid Hickey, a spokesman for the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA), Campos\u2019s union, said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility, UMC Quick Care. But UMC Quick Care says none of their clinics filled out an intake request for a patient by that name, and Campos has been silent since the text; vanishing into thin air. He also isn\u2019t listed on the registry that shows the names of licensed security guards in Nevada.\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d Hickey told media. \u201cI\u2019m hoping everything is OK with him and I\u2019m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,\u201d he said.\nIn the meantime, authorities still have not released a conclusive timeline for the shooting they desperately want us to believe was committed by Paddock. And, according to the latest reports, are still looking for a motive for the shooting.\n", ["Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn\u2019t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s move was not operational. It was directional.\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran. For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran\u2019s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran\u2019s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\nTrump\u2019s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime\u2019s repression of its own people.\nBy merging Iran\u2019s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge \u2013 or expand the wedge \u2013 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran\u2019s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump\u2019s discussion of the nuclear deal \u2013 which was the ostensible subject of his speech. Before Trump discussed Iran\u2019s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama\u2019s nuclear pact. By placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran\u2019s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact. Only then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama\u2019s nuclear accord. Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called \u201csunset\u201d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran\u2019s nuclear advancement.\nTrump\u2019s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran. Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump\u2019s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\nTrump\u2019s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move. He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn\u2019t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama\u2019s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker\u2019s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump\u2019s agenda. If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed. And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama\u2019s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran\u2019s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive \u2013 rather than personal \u2013 debates on Iran.\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama\u2019s Iran policy \u2013 that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program.\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump\u2019s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal. The problem here is not obvious. Clearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran\u2019s nuclear program. An improved deal won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s centrifuges.\nIt won\u2019t take away Iran\u2019s enriched uranium. It won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear installations. And it won\u2019t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat. Distressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump\u2019s speech and its strategic significance.\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat \u2013 grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime \u2013 Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies. If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\nA wider strategy would target Iran\u2019s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. It would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs\u2019 domestic opponents. It would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy. It is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it. If they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion"]], ["FBI Informant \u201cThreatened\u201d After Offering Details Linking Clinton Foundation To Russian Bribery Case\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nWhile the mainstream media has largely ignored it, the scandal surrounding Russian efforts to acquire 20% of America\u2019s uranium reserves, a deal which was ultimately approved by the Obama administration, and more specifically the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which included Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder, is becoming more problematic for Democrats by the hour.\nAs The Hill pointed out earlier this morning, the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the FBI used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a Russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery, extortion and money laundering. The informant, who is so far only known as \u201cConfidential Source 1,\u201d says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration.\nWorking as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show. Sources told The Hill the informant\u2019s work was crucial to the government\u2019s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion. In the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015. Toensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA. \u201cHe can\u2019t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,\u201d she said. The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration\u2019s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation. At the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said. It has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval.\nIn the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), \u201cConfidential Source 1\u201d has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out.\nSitting down with The Hill earlier, Toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out \u201cboth his reputation and liberty\u201d were \u201cthreatened\u201d by the Obama administration in a effort to force his silence.\n\u201cAll of the information about this corruption has not come out,\u201d she said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cAnd so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, \u2018This is wrong. What should I do about it?\u2019\u201d\nToensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the Justice Department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the Russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money Russians stole from him through kickbacks during the FBI probe.\nThe undercover client witnessed \u201ca lot of bribery going on around the U.S.\u201d but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained.\nWhen he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year, \u201cthe Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom. They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,\u201d she added.\nEmails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer.\n\u201cThe government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty,\u201d the civil lawyer wrote in one email. In another, she added, \u201cAs you will recall the gov\u2019t made serious threats sufficient to cause you to withdraw your civil complaint.\u201d\nAs we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and \u2018speaking fees\u2019 from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities.\nRussian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States. Subsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets. In the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation. Moreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank, with ties to the Kremlin, around the same time. Needless to say, the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets.\nMeanwhile, the \u2018journalists\u2019 over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads\u2026\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["Iranian Aggression Intensifies\nLast July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, warned that \u201cputting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.\u201d IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that \"if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.\" The next day the Iranian regime warned of a \"crushing\" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization. President Trump has called the Iranian regime\u2019s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.\nDesignating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. If Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure. The U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime\u2019s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal. The Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.\nWith the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran\u2019s leaders to further finance the IRGC\u2019s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal. Thus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region. A couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran\u2019s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\nOn Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces. Bagheri is quoted as saying that his visit\u2019s purpose was to \u201cput a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.\u201d Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri\u2019s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria. This will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.\nMeanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC\u2019s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there. According to Debkafile, this constitutes \u201cthe first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.\u201d The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi\u2019s oil. The Iraqi branch of Iran\u2019s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.\nIt is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds. The session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members. She went after Iran instead. She explained why the Trump administration decided to take \u201ca comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,\u201d which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,\u201d Ambassador Haley said. \u201cThat\u2019s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran\u2019s outlaw behavior. The United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran\u2019s destructive conduct, not just one aspect. It\u2019s critical that the international community do the same. Judging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat. Iran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior. To do otherwise would be foolish.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to \u201cplay\u201d the Security Council. \u201cIran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior. And we have allowed them to get away with it. This must stop.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah. She also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime\u2019s \u201cmost threatening act\u201d \u2013 its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. \u201cWhen a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,\u201d Ambassador Haley said. \u201cIf it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn\u2019t that same mentality apply to Iran? \u201c\nAs for the Iran\u2019s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN\u2019s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran\u2019s military sites. Past work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA\u2019s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency\u2019s \u201ctools are limited.\u201d The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. The Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was \u201ccaught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.\u201d\nU.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea\u2019s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect. The Obama administration chose to look the other way. Does anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today? Iran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA. It wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities. In addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs. They are a perfect match for each other.\nProponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration\u2019s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles. \"If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,\" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying. Germany is one of the parties to the JCPOA. Other European allies have voiced similar concerns. So have Obama\u2019s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\nThis argument is absurd on its face. The whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as usual. North Korea\u2019s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Madagascar Hospitals On High Alert: \u2018No One Is Safe\u2019 From The Black Plague\nTravelers are being warned to keep their distance from areas of Madagascar affected by the bubonic plague.

Health officials say the disease, which contributed to the deaths of more than 50 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, has spread from rural areas to the more urban areas not usually affected. Hundreds of cases are reported on the tropical island every year, but experts are warning the epidemic is \u201cmuch more dangerous\u201d than in previous years.\nOfficials have reported infections in 17 of the island nation\u2019s 22 regions since the outbreak started in August. And the number of cases is growing by the day, said Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as the nation put all hospitals on high alert. The hospitals have also begun implementing preventative measures with attempts to stall the spread of the bacterial infection.\nThe IFRC said it\u2019s introducing the same \u201csafe and dignified\u201d burial methods used in West Africa during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. This helps cut the chain of transmission by preventing further infections through direct contact with infected corpses.\nLast week, less than 60 people had died and around 600 had been infected. Now, there are 911 confirmed cases in addition to the almost 100 deaths. While cases of bubonic plague occur in Madagascar nearly every year, the much more dangerous and deadly pneumonic plague has never been so prevalent. It arrived earlier than expected this year, and has become much more contagious with it being transmitted from person to person through the air. Pneumonic plague is the most life-threatening form of the infection caused by the manifestation of a Yersinia pestis bacterial infection.\nAlthough the black plague can be treated effectively with antibiotics, the incubation time of this bacteria is incredibly short. Death often occurs within 12-24 hours of becoming infected. The bubonic strain of the disease is spread through the bites of infected fleas, whereas the more contagious and deadly pneumonic type is spread through the coughing or sneezing of an infected person.\nElhadj As Sy said that overcoming the epidemic would require long-term help, not \u201cjust intervening at the peak and then forgetting about it\u201d.

Would the American people support such a war with U.S. troops?\nWould Congress, apparently clueless to the presence of 800 U.S. troops in Niger, authorize a new U.S. war in Syria or Iraq?\nIf Trump and his generals felt our vital interests could not allow Syria and Iraq to drift into the orbit of Iran, where would we find allies for such a fight?\nIf we rely on the Kurds in Syria, we lose NATO ally Turkey, which regards Syria's Kurds as collaborators of the PKK in Turkey, which even the U.S. designates a terrorist organization.\nThe decision as to whether this country should engage in new post-ISIS wars in the Mideast, however, may be taken out of our hands.\nSaturday, Israel launched new air strikes against gun positions in Syria in retaliation for shells fired into the Golan Heights.\nDamascus claims that Israel's \"terrorist\" allies inside Syria fired the shells, to give the IDF an excuse to attack.\nWhy would Israel wish to provoke a war with Syria?\nBecause the Israelis see the outcome of the six-year Syrian civil war as a strategic disaster.\nHezbollah, stronger than ever, was part of Assad's victorious coalition. Iran may have secured its land corridor from Tehran to Beirut. Its presence in Syria could now be permanent.\nAnd only one force in the region has the power to reverse the present outcome of Syria's civil war--the United States.\nBibi Netanyahu knows that if war with Syria breaks out, a clamor will arise in Congress to have the U.S. rush to Israel's aid.\n\"A failure by the United States to defend its allies or promote new political arrangements for (Syria and Iraq) will lead only to more war, the rise of new terrorist threats, and, ultimately, the necessity of more U.S. intervention.\"\nClosing its Sunday editorial the Post instructed the president:The interventionist Post is saying: The situation is intolerable.

But that\u2019s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:\nSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.\u201d (Italics added.)\nThe operative words, of course, are: \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information\u2026.\u201d\nWhat is going on here?\nNegotiations. The art of the deal. The CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records. It has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.\nUnder long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return. That\u2019s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play. Trump wants something in return. We don\u2019t know what \u2014 maybe laying off on the Russia investigation \u2014 but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nWhat Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: \u201cGive me what I want and I\u2019ll give you want you want. Otherwise, I will let all your cherished long-secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people.\u201d\nMake no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made. The CIA will cave. It will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants. Trump is in the driver\u2019s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret. And once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs. All this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.\nThink about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s.\nThe CIA\u2019s ground? \u201cNational security\u201d of course, the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon.\nNational security? Really?\nWhatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term, no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government.\nThe CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret \u201cmethods\u201d of intelligence gathering.\nReally? What, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones?\nWhat is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA\u2019s request for continued secrecy. That should be big news. It\u2019s essentially an admission of guilt, given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that \u201cnational security\u201d would be threatened by the release of the CIA\u2019s long-secret JFK-assassination-related records.\nYou see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination. In their minds, the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president.\nSuch being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.\nLet\u2019s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.\nDon\u2019t forget, after all, that that\u2019s what Oswald said. He said he was being framed. Yet, from the very beginning, the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime. Instead, they have steadfastly stuck with the official story, one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame-up: That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others, both of which lead to nothing but dead ends, contradictions, and anomalies.\nNow, let\u2019s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed. In that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.\nAs part of the frame-up, the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald, its intelligence agent, as a purported communist. That would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist, which, not coincidentally, was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas. In cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.\nIt would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald\u2019s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades. They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.\nThe first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald\u2019s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact. What no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization. It was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.\nBut there was another big operation to establish Oswald\u2019s communist bona fides before the assassination. It had to do with Oswald\u2019s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.\nSomething dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early post-assassination period. Today, Oswald\u2019s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.\nThe CIA\u2019s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise. As I wrote in my October 11 article, \u201cWill Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,\u201d the CIA is between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it knows that those records will further implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination. On the other hand, it knows that by seeking continued secrecy, it\u2019s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.\nNot surprisingly, it is choosing the latter course, especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of \u201cnational security.\u201d\nDo the CIA\u2019s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession? Of course not. And they don\u2019t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy. The CIA\u2019s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.\nBut there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years. Those long-secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, the same types of regime-change operation that took place in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Cuba in 1960-1963, Congo in 1961, and Chile in 1973, all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.\nIn 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations. Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.\nToo bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves. If it did, it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover-up by continuing to keep some of the CIA\u2019s decades-old JFK\u2019s related assassination records secret from the American people.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe Best of Jacob G.

And it\u2019s a crisis of epic proportions.\nOn Friday, former Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla tweeted a photo from inside a hospital, in which scrubbed-up doctors leaned over an operating table performing surgery lit only by a flashlight. According to Slate, the image quickly made the rounds on the internet; it currently has almost 9,000 retweets and many speculate that that\u2019s probably because the blurry picture feels like it\u2019s worth a good deal more than 1,000 words. It illuminates just a small sliver of the public health crisis Puerto Rico is currently facing.\nThis is what POTUS calls a 10!

And calls for help have gone unanswered besides the few willing to travel to the devastated island privately. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) along with a handful of other lawmakers are calling on the federal government to continue to provide aid to the post-apocalyptic ravaged territory.\n\u201cEven before Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the U.S. territories, the islands\u2019 health care system was suffering from the ongoing economic crisis. The islands are grappling with physician shortages, Medicaid programs facing an impending funding cliff, and widespread disparities in Federal health programs\u2014and that was before hurricane season,\u201d the lawmakers stated in a letter. \u201cWe are grateful for the public health emergency declaration in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but more can and should be done to help Americans impacted by these disasters.\u201d\nThe senators stressed that much of the islands\u2019 power and communication networks are out and, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it will take months before power is fully restored. Hospitals have been forced to prioritize patients, ration services, and forgo elective surgeries. The power grid\u2019s failure has caused more problems than many anticipated, like the stall of relief efforts. Without electricity, communications are non-existent too.\nSome 33 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, only 23 percent of residents have electricity, according to Status.pr, which provides daily updates on basic services on the island. While there are still other problems as well, such as gas stations being slow to reopen, and roads getting badly damaged, the power grid\u2019s utter annihilation in the category 4 winds is not just a temporary inconvenience. The different ways that the lack of electricity can set off a cascade of other crises is becoming increasingly clear.\nA giant government-owned hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, arrived in Puerto Rico weeks ago to help out, but many people don\u2019t know about the ship. Without electricity, most cell phone towers are down. But even if communications were working, residents can\u2019t get to the port, as many of the island\u2019s roads are impassable and most are without gasoline to power a car. The ship has extensive space and equipment for trauma care and a large staff, but CNN reported that as of last Tuesday, only 33 of 250 beds were full.\nThe looming crisis seems to be getting worse, not better, and Puerto Rico is experiencing a medical crisis of epic proportions.\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice"]], ["South Florida Muslim Leader Sofian Zakkout\u2019s David Duke Day\nDavid Duke, the white supremacist icon and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, has been denounced by many as a hatemonger, and rightfully so. However, one individual who represents the Muslim community of South Florida, Sofian Zakkout, is enamored with Duke and has been promoting Duke\u2019s bigoted work for many years. Last month, once again, Zakkout chose to showcase this work by posting four consecutive Duke videos on his (Zakkout\u2019s) personal Facebook page. The postings can be rivaled only by Zakkout\u2019s own documented bigotry.\nSofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA). He has ties to two dozen mosques stretching from Palm Beach County down to Miami-Dade.\nOn September 21, 2017, Zakkout took to Facebook and posted four David Duke videos. Three of the videos were put out by Duke\u2019s official website, DavidDuke.com, one referring to CNN news anchor Wolf Blitzer as a \u201cJewish Zionist Agent.\u201d The fourth video was a news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia this past August. At this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one.\nThis was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke. Indeed, he has done so for years.\nIn February 2016, Zakkout publicized on his Facebook page a bizarre Duke report, titled in part \u2018Dr. David Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind\u2026\u2019 Above the posting, Zakkout wrote of Duke, \u201cI respect him for his honesty!\u201d\nIn October 2015, Zakkout posted to Facebook a Duke video, within which Duke makes the wild claim that there has been a \u201ccomplete takeover of American foreign policy and\u2026 American politics by Jewish extremists.\u201d Above the video on Facebook, Zakkout praised Duke, exclaiming \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d\nIn July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring another anti-Semitic Duke video on the AMANA website. The ADL described the video as \u201cvenomous.\u201d Currently, AMANA\u2019s official website contains one more Duke video.\nDavid Duke\u2019s bigoted and inciting material is not the only hate Zakkout promotes. He also pedals much bigotry coming from others, including himself.\nIn July 2017, Zakkout posted on his Facebook page a four-minute portion of a speech given by Louis Farrakhan at the Nation of Islam\u2019s February 2017 Saviors\u2019 Day. On the video, Farrakhan repeatedly refers to Jews as \u201cSatan.\u201d He states to his audience: \u201cReally, they\u2019re not Jews. No, that\u2019s Satan. You should learn to call them by their real name, \u2018Satan.\u2019 You\u2019re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.\u201d\nIn June 2016, Zakkout clicked \u2018like\u2019 under someone else\u2019s Facebook posting (on Zakkout\u2019s personal Facebook page) of a grotesque cartoon containing a worried-looking religious Jew hiding behind an animated tree with a bearded man brandishing a rifle coming towards them. The tree is speaking to the man in Arabic, saying \u201cOh Muslim! Oh Muslim! There is a Jew behind me. Come and kill him.\u201d\nIn April 2016, Zakkout promoted a report discussing the absurd notion of Jewish involvement in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A photo from the report shows the burning towers with a Jewish Star affixed to one. The report begins, \u201cIt ain\u2019t debatable! Soup to nuts, top to bottom, the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington D.C. were an \u2018Israeli\u2019-Jewish job.\u201d The website which published the report and which Zakkout linked to is Mouqawamah Music, a site that openly calls for \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d and labels the Jewish religion \u201cwicked and filth-ridden.\u201d\nIn February 2016, Zakkout circulated on social media a report claiming that \u201cthe Holocaust was faked.\u201d It begins: \u201cThe alleged \u2018Holocaust\u2019 of \u20186 million Jews\u2019 at the hands of Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Germany during WWII is the biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity.\u201d It was produced by The Realist Report, an anti-Jew, anti-black, anti-gay independent media outlet, which describes Hitler as \u201cthe greatest leader in modern Western history.\u201d\nIn December 2015, Zakkout posted a photo of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, who is a decorated veteran of many different wars and battles fought by Israel over the last three-plus decades. Above the picture of Eizenkot, Zakkout wrote in Arabic, \u201cYou\u2019re a Jew, the grandson of a monkey and a pig.\u201d He signed it \u201cSofian.\u201d This is one of many times Zakkout has referred to Jews as \u201cmonkeys and pigs.\u201d\nIn July 2014, Zakkout organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami. On video, Zakkout is shown smiling, as event goers repeatedly shout, \u201cWe are Hamas.\u201d After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: \u201cThank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!\u201d He signed it \u201cBr. Sofian Zakkout.\u201d\nSouth Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout\u2019s promotion of bigotry, whether borrowed from others or his own, has been evident for years. Yet, there is no outcry from the community, not from Muslims, not from non-Muslims. It has been virtually ignored by everyone, save this author and his colleague, Director of Militant Islam Monitor Beila Rabinowitz.\nDespite their having been notified by this author about Zakkout\u2019s perfidious activities, Zakkout remains an active member of the boards of Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County and Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County. These organizations have provided and continue to provide Zakkout with a facade of respectability. In reality, he has done nothing to serve the community and only attempts to divide it with his hatemongering.\nIt is time for Zakkout to be exposed and stripped of his public functions.

As nations grapple with the outbreak of the bubonic plague, nine countries are sounding warnings that the disease is spreading rapidly.\nThe deadly plague outbreak that has struck Madagascar\u2019s major cities has yet to \u201cpeak\u201d and that could make the spread of this infection into the surrounding regions more likely. Dr. Ashok Chopra, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas, told The Sun Online the crisis in Madagascar had yet to peak. He also sounded the alarm to neighboring countries. Since there are regular flights in and out of Madagascar and this outbreak has so far, been impossible to contain, other nations are now at risk.\nSpeaking from Madagascar, Christine South, head of IFRC\u2019s (International Federation of Red Cross) emergency operations, said: \u201cWith anything like this there is a possibility that somebody could be infected and get on a plane. We have done preparedness support to some of the neighboring countries.\u201d Tourists have been warned to stay out of Madagascar until doctors can get the plague under control to prevent its spread.\nThe outbreak is considered a much bigger threat to the region than in previous years because it has taken on its pneumonic form. That means it is airborne and spread by sneezing and coughing. Not only that, but the plague has a very short incubation time. Once exposed, some people will die within 24 hours.\nExperts say the epidemic could still worsen as the death tolls hit 124 and more than 1,300 are left infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has now issued alarming warnings in nine countries too. \u201cIf they are traveling shorter distances and they\u2019re still in the incubation period, and they have the pneumonic (form) then they could spread it to other places,\u201d said Chopra. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a situation where the disease spreads so fast it sort of gets out of control. Most of the cases in the past have been of the bubonic plague but if you look at this particular outbreak, 70 percent of the cases are pneumonic plague, which is the most deadly form of the disease. If the treatment is not given in a very short period of time these people will end up dying.\u201d\nBoth forms of the plague can be cured with antibiotics, but getting treatment quickly is the key to survival.\n", ["Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice"]], ["The Plague Is AIRBORNE And It\u2019s Spreading Because People Are Literally \u2018Dancing With Corpses\u2019\nThe plague that\u2019s airborne and has killed at least 124 people in Madagascar is now blamed on \u201cdancing with corpses.\u201d This is the time of year when the dead are wrapped in sheets and paraded through the streets while others dance around the bodies.\nThe local tradition is said to be one of the major causes of the spread of this disease.

And then they came for everyone else.\nJewish students have already faced plenty of harassment and hate at McGill. The latest incident at the Canadian university comes with a rather blatant agenda.\nA Jewish student at McGill University has been kicked off the student government board for having \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d due to his pro-Israel activism. Third-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society. The ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday\u2019s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university\u2019s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus. Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren\u2019t a fan of the names. When it was Lew\u2019s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote. Two other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O\u2019Manique, were also voted down. Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were \u201cconflicts of interests.\u201d\nSomehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest. But the campus anti-Israel crowd has been working rather hard to intimidate and penalize anyone involved in pro-Israel organizations. And to keep their racist boycott movement going by maintaining control over student governments.\nLew shared the experience on Facebook. \u201cI have no doubt from the information circulated about me and campaign run against me prior to this vote that this was about my Jewish identity, and nothing more,\u201d wrote Lew. \u201cI was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish, because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations, and because I believe in the right to Jewish self-determination.\u201d Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement. \u201cIf BDS is not anti-Semitic, why did a BDS-led campaign name and shame me for my affiliation with a Jewish organization, and call on students to remove me from student government for this reason?\u201d wrote Lew. \u201cIf BDS is not anti-Semitic, why was I barred from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity?\u201d\nThere are some more details here and a petition.\nOn Monday night, three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students\u2019 Society of McGill University (SSMU), McGill\u2019s main student government. All three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti-Jewish discrimination on campus. This episode is utterly unacceptable, and is merely the latest in a long string of antisemitic incidents at your university. Indeed, according to eyewitnesses, one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov. You will remember Sadikov as the student politician who in February told his followers to \u201cpunch a Zionist today.\u201d It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action for this incitement to violence from your administration. Antisemitism at McGill does not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, it has been nurtured in part by a toxic campus press, especially the McGill Daily, a publication which openly refuses to publish any \u201cZionist\u201d content.

On Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination. (See \u201cI Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA\u2019s JFK Assassination Cover-Up\u201d and \u201cNo Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?\u201d)\nOn Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA\u2019s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of \u201cnational security,\u201d more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination.\nPlease, don\u2019t start calling me Nostradamus. A blind man could see what was happening. Donald \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d Trump was obviously negotiating all week with the CIA, and he was obviously pushing to get what he wanted all the way up to the very last day. On Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nSome mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy. Displaying their naivete, they demonstrate their lack of understanding about how things work in Washington, D.C. As I indicated in my Monday article, when someone in the federal government needs a favor from someone else, the someone else is going to ask for something in return. JFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.\nThe fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday. But \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d Trump obviously sat on the request, undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records.\nDon\u2019t forget: According to Trump\u2019s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA\u2019s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:\nTrump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.\u201d Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: \u201cThe long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting!\nNow, it\u2019s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA\u2019s long-secret JFK records. But how likely is that? Not likely at all!\nInstead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records. In the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat. The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nIn the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would. Contrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963. That\u2019s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.\nTrump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel. As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA\u2019s guilt in the assassination. On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw \u2014 that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.\nWhat did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump\u2019s extending the CIA\u2019s 50-year-plus secrecy? We don\u2019t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia. Here\u2019s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump\u2019s supposed \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russia are about to fizzle out. That\u2019s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation. In my opinion, that\u2019s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.\nNotice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April. Ostensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to \u201cnational security.\u201d Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nNot surprisingly, the mainstream media isn\u2019t even questioning that ludicrous notion. For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret. During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years. There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible. Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago. The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why \u201cnational security\u201d would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.\nSo, why the April deadline? Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?\nBecause Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal. If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain. Let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that I\u2019m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation. To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA. If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April. If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.\nLet\u2019s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with \u201cnational security.\u201d They have everything to do with covering up the CIA\u2019s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an...

For a more detailed analysis of motive, read FFF\u2019s ebook JFK\u2019s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne, who served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.\nImmediately upon the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald, the official account was that this was just a lone nut, former U.S. Marine communist who decided, for no apparent reason, to assassinate Kennedy.\nOne big problem is the official story, however, requires a suspension of logic and common sense. For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged. For anyone who has a critical, analytical, independent mindset, the official story is filled with holes.\nFor example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of? Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists? Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists? How many communists do you know who like to kill fellow communists?\nIt gets better. CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.\nAfter Oswald supposedly tried to defect to the Soviet Union and promised U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the Soviet Union, which was America\u2019s sworn Cold War enemy (and former World War II partner and ally), U.S. officials permitted him to return home with a Red wife, without even one grand-jury summons or even an iota of harassment.\nThink about Martin Luther King, John Walker Lindh, Edward Snowden, the U.S. Communist Party, or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Think about how the U.S. national-security establishment treats what it suspects are communists or traitors. It skewers them. Why, just look at how they call Julian Assange a traitor and he isn\u2019t even an American. Recall the McCarthy hearings. Dalton Trumbo. The entire U.S. anti-communist crusade, including Vietnam, which more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers died killing communists.\nAnd they\u2019re going to tell us that they just let Lee Harvey Oswald, a supposed self-avowed communist skate blissfully across the Cold War stage of history with nary any abuse or harassment at all? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\nSoon after the Warren Commission was established, Warren called a super-secret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into Warren\u2019s possession. That information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence. Yes, a spy, the type of people that work for the CIA. That would make sense, especially given that the Marine Corps is a prime recruiting place for the CIA. Semper fidelis!\nNow, suddenly, all the circumstantial evidence in the Kennedy assassination falls into place. It begins to make sense. The mosaic starts to be filled out: They needed to get rid of Kennedy to protect national security and elevate Johnson, who had the same anti-communist mindset as the Pentagon and the CIA, to the presidency. Unlike JFK, who had begun withdrawing troops from Vietnam, Johnson would The Man Who Killed Ken...

They needed to frame someone for the crime. And what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist?\nPart of the scheme, obviously, would be to establish Oswald\u2019s communist bona fides. That\u2019s why he was sent to New Orleans, where, contradictorily, he would work for a right-wing business owner, work with a right-wing former FBI agent, and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba.\nIt was also why he was sent to Mexico City, where he would be ordered to visit the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission, maybe to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro.\nBut no government operation ever goes perfectly. Things obviously went dreadfully wrong with the Mexico City operation because the investigation into it after the assassination was quickly shut down. Today, it remains shrouded in mystery.\nAnd guess what is included in the records that Trump has now agreed to continue suppressing. You guessed it! The CIA\u2019s records relating to Mexico City!\nEver since the assassination, the CIA has argued that the release of any of its JFK records would threaten \u201cnational security.\u201d One thing is for sure and undeniable: Despite the release of many of the CIA\u2019s records in the 1990s and yesterday, the United States did not fall into the ocean or fall to the communists. And neither would it have done so if Trump had not granted the CIA\u2019s request for a continued cover-up of what it did on November 22, 1963.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe Best of Jacob G.

More than 500 injured. And yet, nearly a month after the Las Vegas Strip experienced the worst mass shooting in modern American history, local and federal authorities are refusing to fill in the blanks. It wasn\u2019t always like this. In the days after Oct. 1, when Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd from his Mandalay Bay corner suite, Las Vegas police were hosting multiple news conferences a day. Then, once a day. Then, once every few days. They compiled and released snippets of officers\u2019 body camera footage. They spent several minutes answering specific questions. They released a comprehensive timeline, which ended up being wrong. They took it back, and tried to clarify the errors, but instead caused more confusion. By Oct. 13 \u2014 the last time the Metropolitan Police Department or the FBI addressed the media or public \u2014 something had changed. The sheriff, who had been straightforward and stern, was now emotional and at times combative. Both he and the FBI failed to provide much new information, and at the end of the meeting, they refused to take questions. Since that day, the only person who has shed more light on the investigation is Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, who was shot in the leg while approaching the gunman\u2019s room. His platform to share that information? \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d which aired last week. He hasn\u2019t made himself available to the media since. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Thursday, when asked why there had been no significant updates in two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing investigation, and unless there\u2019s something to report, there will not be a briefing.\u201d Calls to the national FBI office were forwarded back to Breault at the Las Vegas office. At least twice this week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal has asked to speak with Sheriff Joe Lombardo about the shooting investigation. Both times, reporters were told by Carla Alston, the Police Department\u2019s director of communications, that the sheriff \u201cwill not be conducting interviews.\u201d \u201cAs he has stated previously, the case is still ongoing\u201d she said in an email Thursday. \u201cAnother media briefing will be held when we have new and accurate information.\u201d When asked when that briefing would be, Alston guessed it could occur in the next two weeks. The Review-Journal also specifically asked about the more than 50,000 hours of overtime that Metro officers have logged since Oct. 1 on work directly related to the shooting investigation. \u201cInvestigators have made progress on investigative leads and in mapping out Stephen Paddock\u2019s life for the last few years \u2014 and they\u2019re still not done,\u201d Alston said. \u201cWe still have officers dedicated to this case 24/7.\u201d She agreed that members of the public have a right to know more, \u201cbut they have a right to accurate information and not the speculation \u2026 that has filled so many news stories the past month.\u201d Nearly a month after the mass shooting, the gunman\u2019s motive remains a mystery. More straightforward questions also remain unanswered, including whether the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay \u2014 where the gunman was staying \u2014 has surveillance cameras, and what exactly investigators collected in the gunman\u2019s hotel room and homes. Authorities also have not said how long the gunman had a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on his hotel door, and whether hotel staff saw something suspicious in his room but failed to report it. Though authorities have described the investigation as a team effort, they have not explained what role Las Vegas police, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are playing in the case.\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller.\nPamela Geller's commitment to freedom from jihad and Shariah shines forth in her books\n", ["Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Doubt", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["America's Immigration Voice.\nKritarch Patti Saris is in the news again.

She also expressed concern he was being held alongside potentially violent criminals.\nHer problem though was that the law and precedent are on the side of the continued deportation of aliens.

Commonly this the pattern of Judges who don't want to be overruled as frequently as 9th Circuit Judges do. Saris has apparently decided to bend to the inevitable in the case of Indonesians, who had years of hearings and appeals, all to naught, but do a little sabotage instead.However, she will not let it go quietly into the night.What we have here is that Saris realized she has no authority over the deportation of illegal aliens, but she will do her best to throw a wrench in the works by attempting to get illegal aliens released from custody, so they can then disappear into the United States and consequently not be deported.\n(a) Arrest, detention, and release On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States.

But the oncoming rainy season could see the number of those infected explode exponentially. The rainy season poses a threat to the containment of the plague because outbreaks of this magnitude often seem to be seasonal.\nThe Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase. Its website said that \u201coutbreaks of plague tend to be seasonal and occur mainly during the rainy season.\u201d The African island\u2019s wet season officially began today and will last until the end of April, meaning the downward trend the plague had seen over the past few days, will likely turn upward again.\nBecause the disease can be spread easily through a cough or sneeze, experts are fearful. It would take just one infected traveler who made it to Africa\u2019s mainland or even nearby British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles to spread the disease globally. The Seychelles is currently putting anyone traveling from Madagascar into quarantine on arrival as a precaution.\nThe outbreak has been fueled by performing the ancient practice of Famadihana. Famadihana is the \u201cdancing with the dead\u201d ritual which sees locals dig up deceased relatives and dance with them before they are reburied.

Olivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger said: \u201cThe epidemic is ahead of us, we have not yet reached the peak.\u201d\nAs many as 50 aid workers are believed to have been among the 1,200 people infected with the more dangerous airborne pneumonic strain of the disease.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue\nThe Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB\u2019s decision to sack Fr.

Weinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican\u2019s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused \u201cchronic confusion\u201d among the faithful and bishops.\nHe wrote to the pope, \u201cTo teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\u201d He added that Catholics are \u201cdisconcerted\u201d by the appointment of bishops \u201cwho seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief, but who support and even defend them.\u201d\nIn an interview yesterday with John Allen\u2019s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops. Neither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.\u201d\n\u201cBishops are quick learners,\u201d he wrote in his letter, \u201cand what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it,\u201d claiming that many bishops don\u2019t speak out publicly for fear they will be \u201cmarginalized or worse.\u201d\nAnd sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr. Weinandy had been given the boot. Of course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.\nPerhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops \u2013 as with nearly all the episcopate \u2013 are to what political analysts call the \u201coptics\u201d. Political consultants often ask: how does it look? And it looks extremely bad. As though the fog of irony weren\u2019t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis\u2019 cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account. Which, it must be said, only proves Fr. Weinandy\u2019s point once again.\nSome of the criticism has been unusually sharp. Fr. Hunwicke wrote this afternoon, \u201cThis cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope] F[rancis] is presiding over a bully-boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes. Just as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.\u201d\nAs I write this, the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down, and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics \u2013 even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists \u2013 have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies. In his letter, Fr. Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis\u2019 agenda.\nIn fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,\n\u201cI see that Fr. Thomas Weinandy has been squashed. He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet. To me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.\nHe is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching. I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience. I imagine that it\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.\u201d\nWhen I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK\u2019s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, \u201cThis is absolutely right. Not a man to seek out confrontation.\u201d\nThe Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr. Weinandy\u2019s concerns. He said the pope is\u2026\nFostering \u201cchronic confusion.\u201d\n\u201cDemeaning\u201d the importance of doctrine.\nAppointing bishops who \u201cscandalize\u201d believers with dubious \u201cteaching and pastoral practice.\u201d\nGiving prelates who object the impression they\u2019ll be \u201cmarginalized or worse\u201d if they speak out.\nCausing faithful Catholics to \u201close confidence in their supreme shepherd.\u201d\nOur friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read. Fr. Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Like the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.\nNotable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people. The pope, he said, seems \u201cto censor and even mock\u201d critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a \u201ckind of calumny\u2026alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.\u201d\nIn an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but \u201cmore concerned about the good that my letter might do.\u201d The letter \u201cexpresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who\u2019ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions. I wanted them to know that I listened.\u201d\n\u201cI have done what I believe God wanted me to do,[1]\u201d he said.\nIn fact, Fr. Weinandy has bolstered my own \u201cGreat Clarifier\u201d theory, saying that this pontificate, and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops, is being allowed by God in order to reveal \u201cjust how weak is the faith of many within the Church,\u201d He added that Francis has revealed that many in the Church \u201chold harmful theological and pastoral views.\u201d\nWhich inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.\nWhen Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a \u201cgood\u201d prelate being got rid of. And it seems clear from the way it was done, and the way Francis treated Muller in general, that he was indeed got rid of. But his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span. Ed Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he\u2019s on.\nA quick examination of Muller\u2019s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is \u2013 so I am told by sources close to him \u2013 motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the \u201ccool kids\u201d in the Vatican, on the one hand, and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other.\nMost recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, \u201cCardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of \u2018Amoris Laetitia\u2019\u201d in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.\nSignaling furiously with the trendy FrancisChurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence, Muller writes that \u201cmitigating factors in guilt,\u201d can lead, couples in \u201can uncertain marital situation\u201d through a \u201cpath of repentance\u201d \u2013 always \u201caccompanied\u201d by an exquisitely sensitive confessor \u2013 to a point where the reception of Communion is no longer sinful. Presumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful. Or sacrilege either, I guess. Or something. Somehow the \u201cnew evangelization\u201d is involved in this, though it\u2019s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it\u2019s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can\u2019t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.\nWe hear again, as we did incessantly from the Kasperians at the Synods, about the hard case of the poor, poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband, and who \u201cfinds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kind-hearted person,\u201d \u2026 with whom, I guess, she has also no choice but to have sexual relations. Because of kind-heartedness.\nAnyway, the result of this is a \u201cmarriage-like relationship\u201d about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things. Or be too \u201cextreme\u201d. It\u2019s very important for him to avoid a \u201ccheap adaptation to the relativistic Zeitgeist,\u201d on one side, and a \u201ccold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules,\u201d on the other. Because that could be too polarizing. And mean.\nAnd anyway, sins of the flesh aren\u2019t the worst things ever. There are, like, \u201cdifferent levels\u201d of gravity, you know? And, like, it depends on the type of sin, right? \u201cSpirit\u2019s sins\u201d like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than \u201csins of the flesh,\u201d you know? Which are, like, only a result of \u201chuman weakness,\u201d right?\nApparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the \u201cpolarization\u201d it has caused has been \u201cregrettable\u201d. The question of Communion for divorced and civilly \u201cremarried\u201d Catholics, he said, has been \u201cfalsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of Catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal, in favor or against the pope.\u201d\nFor years under Pope Benedict, Muller was engaged in an open war with the German episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow Communion for the divorced and remarried, no matter what Rome said, even threatening to go into schism if they didn\u2019t get their way[2].\nMuller, with little backing from Pope Benedict \u2013 who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences \u2013 and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line. The fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault. And it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.\nBut since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides. Reportedly removed from CDF \u2013 and of course lionized by \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 for his mild and equivocating opposition to Amoris Laetitia, Muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps. With this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.\nPerhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr. Weinandy\u2019s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act. As my friend said, maybe \u201cit\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,\u201d assuming there are any left.\nCatch Hilary's regular column in The Remnant's Print/E-edition.

Weinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a \u201csign\u201d that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: \u201cIf you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,\u201d Weinandy recalls saying. \u201cTomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to Saint Mary Major\u2019s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran.

This shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up.\nAs far back as 1953, the CIA published an assassination manual that the CIA succeeded in keeping secret from the American people for more than 40 years. It came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request. That was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963.\nToday, Americans can read the CIA\u2019s assassination manual online. Titled \u201cStudy of Assassination,\u201d the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people. Here is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:\nFirearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively\u2026. Public figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion. The propaganda value of this system may be very high.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nThe manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected. Note the following excerpt:\nFor secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique. When successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.\nIt would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual. That\u2019s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination. We can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone. The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob G Hornberger Best Price: $9.85 Buy New $9.95 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details)\nThe CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime-change operation in Guatemala, one that was designed to violently remove the nation\u2019s democratically elected socialist president, Jacobo Arbenz, from office and replace him with an unelected, right-wing, pro-U.S. military general.\nAs part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated. While the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.\nThere is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.\nSo, why were they targeted for assassination? Because Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later. That\u2019s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.\nAlthough Arbenz was able to escape the country, the CIA\u2019s regime-change operation was a total success, with Arbenz being replaced by the pro-U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala.\nThe Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious. The CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting \u201cnational security\u201d by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general. Tracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA\u2019s second-highest medal.\nThe CIA\u2019s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.\nThe doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front. At a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound \u2014 the one in the front of Kennedy\u2019s neck \u2014 was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\nThis necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\nKeep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence. But he also went a step further. He said that he was being framed for the crime.\nThe obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front? Wouldn\u2019t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?\nThat\u2019s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.\nIf Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.\nWho would those confederates be? There could be only one answer: communists. Soviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.\nHow would we know this? That\u2019s where Oswald\u2019s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play. Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nOswald traveled to Mexico City where he purportedly visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies and where he supposedly met with a premier assassin for the Soviet Union.\nKeep in mind that this was the height of the Cold War between the United States and that the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, had taken place the previous year.\nSo, President Kennedy has been assassinated. Oswald is immediately arrested. He has confederates firing from the front, who almost certainly are Soviet and Cuban communists, especially since Oswald has supposedly just recently visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City.\nWhat does all that mean? An assassination of the president by the Soviet Union and Cuba is obviously an act of war. That means nuclear war is about to break out because there is no way that the United States is going to sit idly by when the Reds have just assassinated America\u2019s president.\nExcept for one thing: The communist part and the nuclear-war part were concocted. That was all part of the plan. That was the ingenious way that the CIA was able to get the investigation into the assassination squelched just as soon as Oswald was murdered.\nIn the early days of the Warren Commission, commission chairman Earl Warren called a top-secret meeting of the commission. Its purpose was to discuss information that Warren had received that Oswald was actually a U.S. intelligence agent or an informant for the FBI or both.\nHow did Warren resolve this troubling issue? He simply asked the heads of the CIA and FBI whether it was true. They said no. That was the end of the matter.\nThe issue was so sensitive that Warren ordered the members of the commission to never reveal the meeting to the American people. He ordered all notes and other written references to be destroyed. He also ordered the court reporter to destroy her notes of the meeting. Unbeknownst to him, the court reporter inadvertently kept a recording of the meeting that ultimately came to light.\nThis troubling issue arose again yesterday, November 2, in the Washington Post in an article entitled \u201cTantalizing Mystery of JFK Assassination Files Solved \u2013 23 Years Ago.\u201d In the article, author Ian Shapira points out that among the long-secret CIA records that were recently released was a deposition of former CIA Director Richard Helms taken in 1975 before the President\u2019s Commission on CIA Activities, which stated as follows:\nBELIN: Well, now, the final area of my interrogation relates to charges that the CIA was in some way conspiratorially involved with the assassination of President Kennedy. During the time of the Warren Commission, you were Deputy Director of Plans, is that correct? HELMS: I believe so. BELIN: Is there any information involved with the assassination of President Kennedy which in any way shows that Lee Harvey Oswald was in some way a CIA agent or an age[nt.\u2026 The CIA, Terrorism, an... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.\nThat\u2019s where the transcript ends according to few secret records of the CIA that were recently released by the National Archives.\nShapira points out, \u201cSeveral news organizations, including The Washington Post, seized on the truncated file as an example of the government\u2019s continued secrecy about the assassination.\u201d Shapira points out that Helms\u2019 full deposition has been in the public arena since 1994.\n(The year 1994 was during the tenure of the Assassination Records Review Board, the agency charged with securing the mandated release of JFK assassination records from the CIA and other federal agencies. The ARRB Had been formed after Americans had learned of the official secrecy after watching Oliver Stone\u2019s movie JFK, which posited that the JFK assassination was a U.S. regime-change operation, no different in principle from the one the CIA had carried out in Guatemala nine years before.)\nShapira then proceeds to provide the answer that Helms gave, which, as he points out, has been public:\nHELMS: Mr. Belin, this question, and I think you may recall this, was raised at the time and the Agency was never able to find any evidence whatsoever, and we really searched that it had any contact with Lee Harvey Oswald. As far as the FBI was concerned, my recollection is not all that precise. I believe that Mr. Hoover testified that he had not been an agent of theirs either. He was certainly not an agent of the CIA. He was certainly never used by the CIA. Whether any CIA officer ever talked to him any place or not I don\u2019t know but I certainly felt quite comfortable \u2014 I believe Mr. [John] McCone [a previous CIA director] was asked to testify before the Commission on this point. I believe he was asked to testify. It was a hot item anyway at the time. And my recollection is that I informed Mr. McCone that we could find no evidence that Oswald had any connection with the CIA.\nShapira ends his article by suggesting that commentators should do more complete research, maybe even use Google, before they jump to conclusions.\nBut Shapira would be wise to follow his own advice because he himself is guilty of what he accuses others of. That\u2019s because he failed to conclude his article with one great big important point about former CIA Director Richard Helms.\nWhat is that great big important point that Shapira, who, according to his tagline on his article, \u201cenjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities,\u201d left out of his article?\nPerjury. He left out that former CIA Director Richard Helms was a perjurer. A liar. A CIA official who would tell falsehoods, even under oath, whenever he felt that \u201cnational security\u201d required it.\nShapira failed to note that Helms was convicted in a federal district court of lying to Congress under oath about another CIA regime-change operation ten years after the Kennedy assassination in Chile.\nInteresting enough, in the Chile regime-change operation, the CIA and the Pentagon were telling their counterparts in the Chilean national-security establishment that they had a moral duty to violate their nation\u2019s constitution and violently remove their nation\u2019s democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, from office. The reason? Allende was reaching out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as Arbenz had done and just as Kennedy had done. JFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.\nThus, given that Helms was an admitted perjurer and convicted liar, what value does his denial that Oswald was an intelligence agent have? It has no value at all. And Shapira, who \u201cenjoys writing about people who have served in the military and intelligence communities\u201d had an ethical duty to point out Helms\u2019 proclivity for lying in his article.\nThe circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly establishes that Oswald was working for U.S. intelligence. How often have you ever heard of a U.S. Marine communist? If Oswald was a genuine communist, why would he have joined the Marines in the 1950s, given that the Marines hated communists and had just helped kill millions of them in the Korean War? Why would a genuine communist want to join an organization in which he could be ordered, on a moment\u2019s notice, to return to Korea or be sent to Vietnam, Laos, China, the Soviet Union, or Europe to kill communists? Don\u2019t forget: this is the height of the Cold War!\nAfter Oswald supposedly tried to \u201cdefect\u201d to the Soviet Union and promised to give the Russians all the secrets he learned about in the military, why would U.S. officials agree to let him back in the country, and with a communist wife? Why wouldn\u2019t they indict him or at least haul him before a federal grand jury to testify as to what secrets he gave the Russians? Why wouldn\u2019t they harass, abuse, humiliate, persecute, or prosecute him, like they did to Martin Luther King, Dalton Trumbo, John Walker Lindh, Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and other people they have deemed to be communists or traitors? How is it possible that Oswald could learn fluent Russian while serving in the U.S. military without having U.S. military tutors teaching him? How is it possible that a veteran who embarrasses the U.S. Marine Corps by openly proselytizing for communism in New Orleans is able to saunter across the Cold War stage of history, not long after the McCarthy hearings, without nary a care in the world?\nThe answer: Helms lied. There is no reasonable doubt that Oswald was a U.S. intelligence agent, one who was ordered to travel to Mexico City to set the framework for his frame-up.\nBut things obviously went dreadfully wrong in Mexico City, which is why the CIA had to shut down that part of the post-assassination investigation. Not surprisingly, the CIA\u2019s Mexico City operations regarding Oswald are among the 98 percent of the records that Trump and the CIA have chosen to continue keeping secret from the American people, on grounds of \u201cnational security\u201d of course.\nThus, when Oswald was claiming that he was being framed, there could be only one entity that he could have been thinking about: the CIA, the agency whose officials, as former Washington Post investigative reporter Jefferson Morley has documented, were secretly monitoring his activities in the weeks leading up to the assassination, no doubt to ensure that Oswald had not figured out what was about to happen to him.\nWe can assume that any frame-up by the CIA is going to be good. The operation is going to be carefully planned and executed.\nBut no plan is perfect. Things are inevitably going to go wrong. The pieces aren\u2019t going to fit together perfectly. The Mexico City operation is a good example of that. That\u2019s why the CIA has to continue keeping those records secret.\nBut here\u2019s another example, a small but important one: Recall that Oswald supposedly hid the rifle before he headed down the steps from the sixth floor of the school book depository. Ask yourself: If someone has just assassinated the president of the United States, is he really going to take the time to hide the rifle? What good would that do? Wouldn\u2019t officials conduct a thorough search of the area? Wouldn\u2019t an assassin instead simply leave the rifle there and get out of there as soon as he could?\nThen why the hidden rifle? Because it\u2019s consistent with a frame-up. The framers had to hide the rifle in advance in a place where no one CIA & JFK: The Secret ... Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing. would see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.\nNo matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation. That\u2019s where ingenuity and cunning come into play. They had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.\nThat\u2019s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear. The idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald\u2019s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.\nIt was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history. They get the body out of Parkland by force, in violation of Texas law, and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland, which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy. (See my book The Kennedy Autopsy.) Lyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war. As soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI. At the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately. Lyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III. Johnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA\u2019s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.\nThen keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won\u2019t care anymore who killed President Kennedy. And employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d to confound and confuse the public. And smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a \u201ccommunist sympathizer\u201d or a \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d\nThe CIA\u2019s cunning cover-up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly. Thanks to President Trump and the CIA\u2019s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA\u2019s decades-long secret records secret from the American people, the CIA\u2019s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe Best of Jacob G.

The latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU).\nAt the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School\u2019s student society. He was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances. This is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill. The toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus. Lew followed the advice and was elected as a board member. His \u201csecret\u201d was intact.\nBDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel. In fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed. Finally, in June 2016, SSMU\u2019s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill\u2019s undergraduate student union constitution.\nThe Board\u2019s ruling, which is called a \u201creference,\u201d was then referred to SSMU\u2019s directors for ratification. SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the \u201creference.\u201d Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers. The malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought.\nLew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones. Campus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called \u201cDemocratize SSMU\u201d movement. But Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic. Its raison d'\u00eatre was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.\nAs an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against \u201cZionists.\u201d As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill\u2019s Arts Undergraduate Society. Sadikov made light of his \u201cpunch a Zionist\u201d tweet calling it a \u201cmisguided joke.\u201d It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nMcGill\u2019s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances. Democratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew\u2019s ethnicity as a reason for his removal. An enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.\nIn October, SSMU\u2019s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors. According to Lew, \u201chistorically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.\u201d But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol. In this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time. It was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst. The bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts.\nBut this time, they may have gone too far. Even by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale. BDS activists generally avoid reference to \u201cJews\u201d by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute \u201cZionists\u201d for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions. But in the instant case, McGill\u2019s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews.\nThe vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter. Even SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.\nOne can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action. Judging by past \u201cinvestigations\u201d conducted by other schools \u2013 SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few \u2013 I am not optimistic.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was \u201cAnother Active Shooter\u201d In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack\nNewly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.\nThe audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.\nIntellihub\u2019s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.\n\u201cWe have a firefighter\u2019s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.

Weinandy. The former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop\u2019s conference, Fr. Weinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. None other than Francis appointed Fr. Weinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church. One of the world\u2019s most renowned theologians, Fr. Weinandy is a \u201cman of the Council\u201d and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream.\nYet Fr. Weinandy\u2019s letter, sent to Francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him\u2014along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity\u2014is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the Church. The key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology\u2014precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:\nYour Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate\u2026. This fosters within the faithful a growing unease \u2026.\nIn \"Amoris Laetitia,\" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching\u2026.\nTo teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it.\n[Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia\" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism. This kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry\u2026.\nSuch behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by \u201cad hominem\u201d arguments.\n[T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine. Again and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life.\nYour critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology. But it is precisely Christian doctrine\u2026 that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel.\nThose who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!] separate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth\u2026 What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology \u2013 one that conforms to the world of sin and death.\n[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them.\nWhat scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice\u2026.\nAs a result, many of the faithful, who embody the \"sensus fidelium,\" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd.\n[T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity. But your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite\u2026.\nYou have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church. You have frequently encouraged\u2026 all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think. But\u2026 what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it\u2026 Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse.\nI have often asked myself: \"Why has Jesus let all of this happen?\" The only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church, even among too many of her bishops. Ironically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness\u2026.\nFather Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven. As he recounts here, after repeatedly \u201cbeseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,\u201d he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d\nAt lunch the next day, the sign was given. An old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy\u2019s books, said: \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d\nWrites Fr. Weinandy: \u201cI could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes. But there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something. I also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used. I considered it an apostolic mandate.\u201d\nCan we doubt that it was indeed an apostolic mandate? Can we not see in Fr. Weinandy a voice raised up by heaven itself to say, from deep within the post-conciliar ecclesial establishment, things that exceed in their candor what even certain traditionalist commentators have ventured to state?\nThis article is featured in the new Print/E-edition of The Remnant.\nCheck out the PREVIEW and Subscribe Today!\nAs if to confirm the validity of his own indictment of this pontificate, only a day after this letter was published, the USCCB demanded that Fr. Weinandy resign his current position as a consultant to the U.S. bishops. He has done so. Fr. Fessio\u2019s Catholic World Report, another voice of the rising mainstream opposition to Francis, notes that \u201cIn making such a request, the USCCB, it would appear, reinforces Fr. Weinandy\u2019s very point about fearfulness and lack of transparency.\u201d\nFr. Weinandy\u2019s intervention gives us hope that the plan to remake the Church according to the mind of Bergoglio will ultimately encounter a resistance that will bring an end to the Latin American-style dictatorship Francis has imposed upon the Church, even as he speaks of dialogue, collegiality, decentralization and parreshia (but only for those who agree with him).

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to enforce those deportation orders, called Final Order Of Removal\nDuring the 10 or so years that the cases involving Indonesian Christians were free to remain in the United States, those illegal aliens did not make any effort to appeal their outstanding orders. Then the United States had an election, and the policy of not enforcing those and many other Final Orders of Removal was ended.\nThen suddenly, those illegal aliens claimed they were being denied an opportunity to file for asylum or were not receiving due process. They filed a case in the Federal courts and were assigned to a Kritarch, Patti Saris, who apparently thinks she runs immigration policy, even after aliens have had their day in court. Saris thinks she can usurp the Constitution of the United States based on her whims regarding immigration policy.\nKritarch Patti Saris\nIn her latest excursion into immigration enforcement policy, she decided that illegal aliens can't be held in custody for their return to their home country.\nBOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration\u2019s order to deport them. The man, Terry Rombot, had been allowed to remain under the terms of a 2010 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until this year, when President Donald Trump instructed ICE that all people living in the United States illegally were subject to deportation. [U.S. Judge Frees Indonesian Immigrant Held By Trump Order, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, November 1, 2017]\nFirst, let's deal with the misleading reporting. Rombot was not taken into custody based on any ICE policy of deporting all illegal aliens. Rombot was taken into custody because he had an outstanding Final Order Of Removal; that's a big difference and symptomatic of the lies from reporters like Raymond.\nSaris previously ordered a stay to the deportations. She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.\nNow, with regard to Saris, she has no authority to interfere with the pre-deportation custody of an illegal alien with a Final Order Of Removal. Rombot was taken into custody because he was soon to be deported. There was no issue of Indonesia not accepting him nor of Indonesia not providing a travel document, so there was no question of him being held in custody longer than allowed in the St. Cyr decision that restricted custody of illegal aliens with Final Orders Of Removal who for whatever reason were unlikely to be successfully deported. She still thinks that she can review the underlying decision of the immigration court as well.In fact, Saris' actions appear to more akin to that of the Mexican kritarch Monica Herranz who aided an illegal alien to escape arrest by ICE when she let that illegal alien leave her courtroom through the exit to her judicial chambers. Saris is clearly scheming to help Rombot escape deportation by disappearing into the almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding from Final Orders of Removal\nTime for Congress to impeach Saris and to remove authority from lesser courts to review immigration law enforcement, detention, and deportation decisions.\n", ["Red_Herring", "Causal_Oversimplification", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Repetition"]], ["Deadly Plague Could MUTATE And Become Untreatable As It Spreads Globally\nThe pneumonic plague has already infected 2,000 in Madagascar and killed 143 in the country\u2019s worst outbreak in 50 years.

This one pertains to an astonishing prophecy by Saint Francis of Assisi about a future occupant of the Chair of Peter:\nA short time before the holy Father\u2019s [St. Francis\u2019] death, he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles:\n\u201cAct bravely, my brethren; take courage and trust in the Lord. The time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions; perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound; the charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase. The devils will have unusual power; the immaculate purity of our Order, and of others, will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who obey the true Supreme Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal ears and perfect charity.\n\u201cAt the time of this tribulation a man, not canonically elected, will be raised to the Pontificate, who, by his cunning, will endeavour to draw many into error and death. Then scandals will be multiplied, our Order will be divided, and many others will be entirely destroyed, because they will consent to error instead of opposing it.\n\u201cThere will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God\u2026.\n\u201cThose who persevere in their fervor and adhere to virtue with love and zeal for the truth, will suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics; for their persecutors, urged on by the evil spirits, will say they are rendering a great service to God by destroying such pestilent men from the face of the earth\u2026\n\u201cSome preachers will keep silent about the truth, and others will trample it under foot and deny it. Sanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it, for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them, not a true Pastor, but a destroyer.\u201d [paragraph breaks added]\nThis quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father, St. Francis of Assisi, published in 1882 by the London-based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne, 1882, pp. 248-250). It is readily available as a Google book. The same book, it must be noted, contains an appendix setting forth \u201cDoubtful Works of Saint Francis,\u201d of which the quotation is not part. Thus, the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal. Moreover, in 1882 there could hardly have been any \u201cradical traditionalist\u201d motive to circulate phony quotations of the saint.\n\"St. Francis in Ecstacy\", Caravaggio, 1595\nSaint Francis\u2019 prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a \u201cdestroyer\u201d on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as \u201cschismatics.\u201d But it does contain elements very familiar to us today. And what inference might one draw from the coincidence that Saint Francis\u2019 prophecy of a future \u201cdestroyer\u201d in the papal office seems to correspond rather well with the pontificate of the only Pope who has taken Francis\u2019 name as his own?\nSomething else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office. That is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith. Rather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another \u201capocryphal\u201d quotation:\nJust as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church. I say that it is licit to resist by not doing what he orders and by preventing his will from being executed\u2026\nDe Controversiis on the Roman Pontiff, trans. Ryan Grant (Mediatrix Press: 2015), Book II, Chapter 29, p. 303.\nDid Saint Francis predict the coming of Pope Francis? That is not for us to judge, although the Church may\u00ad well issue a judgment of Francis like that of the posthumous anathema of Honorius\u00ad\u00ad I. Would Saint Francis have been horrified by the words and deeds of the Pope who has presumed to take his name? That question answers itself.\n", ["Conversation_Killer", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Newly Released Private Surveillance Footage From The Las Vegas Massacre Shows \u201cHelicopter Hovering Overhead\u201d During The Attack\nNewly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack.\nOver the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible.\nAs Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, \u201cThe [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business\u2019s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1. The tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.\u201d\nAmazingly, the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a \u201clarge amount\u201d of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it.\n\u201cAstonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,\u201d Ambellas continued.\n\u201cBy 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,\u201d Carlson reported. \u201cYou can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.\u201d\nThe footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late.\nAmbellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.\nA quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen. However, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer. In fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.\nAs I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city.\n\u201cFootage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,\u201d read a report in The Daily Sheeple.\n\u201cDespite claims by some that these are \u201cstrobes\u201d it remains unlikely that this is the case, especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air.\u201d\nIt is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack.\n\u201cIn what can only be described as a \u201cWTF video\u201d the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert.\u201d\nAdditionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it.\nWhile we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre, the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up.\n", ["Doubt", "Loaded_Language"]], ["America's Immigration Voice.\nEver thought that the academic discipline of history has gone to the Diversity dogs?

With the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as \u201c100 percent likely.\u201d\nThe plague death toll has now shown signs that it\u2019s picking up speed again. Official figures reveal 165 people have now lost their lives in Madagascar\u2019s \u201cworst outbreak in 50 years.\u201d Recent data shows a 15 percent jump in fatalities over just three days, coupled with scientists concerned that the black death has reached a \u201ccrisis\u201d point. Ten other African countries have also been placed on high alert, warning that an outbreak could occur at any time.\nAt least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics. Some experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year\u2019s outbreak \u2013 which is expected to blight Madagascar until April. Others worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain. The plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours. That would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country. This form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year. The bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the \u201cBlack Death\u201d in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people. But with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren\u2019t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.\nPaul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea. He previously said: \u201cThe big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it\u2019s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control. If we don\u2019t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.\u201d There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control. We are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.\u201d But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur. Hopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.\nA few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region. Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities. Conway is saying it\u2019s \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before the disease arrives on British soil. Conroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more \u2013 it\u2019s just a question of \u2018when\u2019, not \u2018if\u2019. And it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that this is a real threat \u2013 a ticking time bomb that\u2019s waiting to decimate the world,\u201d Conroy continued. \u201cWith the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.\u201d\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["House of Representatives Paid $15,000,000 To Sexual Harassment Victims\nDid you know that the House of Representatives has paid out $15,000,000 to victims of sexual harassment in recent years?\nI am going to share some things with you in this article that are deeply disturbing, but it is for a purpose.\nThe status quo is not acceptable in Washington, and once people truly understand how deep the corruaption runs I believe that they will get motivated to finally drain the swamp once and for all.

And the young staffer \u2014 it was a young woman \u2014 went there and was greeted with a member in a towel. It was a male, who then invited her in. And at that point, he decided to expose himself. She left, and then she quit her job. She left, she found another job.\nOf course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.

But experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying.

Professor John Joe McFadden from the University of Surrey told MailOnline: \u201cFortunately in [the] plague, it has not developed much antibiotic resistance. If that kicks in, the plague will be far, far scarier. If you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable.\u201d\nDr. Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University\u2019s biomedical and life-sciences department, told MailOnline the country would struggle \u201cto cope\u201d if cases continue to spiral. \u201cMadagascar, typically like many African countries, doesn\u2019t have many doctors. There are around three-and-a-half thousand doctors for 22 million people. They only have around 6,000 hospital beds, so they aren\u2019t particularly well positioned to cope with these kind of events. And if it wasn\u2019t for the international aid coming in things would definitely be much worse for them.\u201d\nAnd experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed.

People here are not used to the hospital. \u201cThe problem of plague is not just a medical response. You can have hospitals but if people don\u2019t come it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Such incidents have prompted fears that the plague could spread even further with each confirmed case requiring 20 people have been in contact with to be treated as a precaution. Malagasy people have also been told not to carry out their traditional burial tradition of Famidihana which involves digging up their dead relatives every seven years. It means \u2018turning the bones\u2019 and sees families cleaning the remains, rewrapping them and reburying them while other family members perform a special dance. The African island\u2019s government has told citizens to pause the tradition for fear the plague bacteria is still active in the corpses and can be spread to the living.\nNews of infected patients running away from hospitals comes on the heels of reports that it is only a matter of time before the plague becomes resistant to the antibiotics that are currently being used to treat the outbreak.\nMac Slavo recently reported for SHTFplan:\nThe newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released. Officials warn that it\u2019s inevitable that this bacterial infection that\u2019s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics. The only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics. But experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying. Once the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.\nAs Slavo noted, should the disease spread to the African mainland, one can assume that it will be all but impossible to control, thus increasing the likelihood of global pandemic.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Black Death Warning: The Plague Is Impossible To Eradicate\nFace masks are placed on children in Antananarivo, Madagascar (AP Photo/Alexander JOE)\nAn expert is warning the plague that has sickened over 2000 people in Madagascar since August is impossible to eradicate.

That\u2019s because the bacteria that causes plague is now so widespread in wildlife, that humans can\u2019t do anything to get rid of it, said Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to eradicate plague, as it is widespread in wildlife rodents outside the sphere of human influence,\u201d Cheng wrote on The Conversation. \u201cOutbreaks, generally, are managed reactively by \u2018firefighting teams\u2019, deployed to clear houses of fleas, identify and treat cases and give pre-emptive treatment to contacts at risk. A more preventative approach, such as the identification of areas at risk using climate models and animal surveys to focus flea and rat control efforts, would be better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, this requires a better understanding of transmission pathways in each region where disease persists.\u201d\nThe best way to stop the plague spreading was to focus on flea and rat control in the most at-risk areas, he said.

Nine countries were urged by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to prepare for a black death attack, at the end of October.\nIt\u2019s been reported that plague has been transmitted to humans by camels, goats, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and guinea pigs since the 1960\u2019s. There are only a few remaining hotspots for plague in the world \u2013 Madagascar being one of them. This outbreak was also highly \u201cunusual\u201d, in that several different parts of the island were affected, including areas with lots of people.\nWHO has reported 2119 cases of the plague as of November 10. 171 have died of the disease so far.\n", ["Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice"]], ["How Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?\nHow Do You Like Paying For Sexual Harassment Settlements from Your Congress, America?\nPlease help support us with cryptocurrency donations.

Now, more than a year after the investigations began, it\u2019s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong\u2026 but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves).\nOn Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family.

Solomon reporting according to the memos obtained, the FBI informant that now has had his NDA lifted at the center of this case gathered years and years of evidence of Russia\u2019s plot to control U.S. Nuclear fuel, which included the uranium one deal. And Sara Carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia\u2019s involvement in uranium one. Also joining us now is the attorney for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing along with John and Sara. Sara, let\u2019s start with your report. A treasure trove, that is huge.\nSARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean. I mean there\u2019s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it\u2019s very evident of Russia\u2019s intention to enter the American market, energy market. And their intentions to acquire uranium one.\nHANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant \u2014 you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years. He has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further. Go into your report.\nJOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market. This is an email that the FBI has had for six years. It shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control, not just benefit from the global market, controlled the global market. That would put the United States at a disadvantage. That is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now. If you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there\u2019s no connection to uranium one. These are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files. They said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case. We now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration. There are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don\u2019t agree with.\nHANNITY: All right. I got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note. The knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation. Sara, is that true?\nCARTER: I believe that is true. I mean especially when we at \u2014\nHANNITY: Do believe or you know? I can\u2019t ask Victoria that question because she won\u2019t tell me.\nCARTER: I know it\u2019s true. I know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what\u2019s important here. The Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this. This is still out there. They are looking into it. That is something that they need to decide. But whether it\u2019s a special counsel or whether it\u2019s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money. There are somethings said \u2026\nHANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation. How good are my instincts?\nCARTER: You have pretty good instincts. I think there\u2019s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well. Remember this is like peeling back an onion. You peel one part and then you find another part. And that is what\u2019s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.\nHANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.\nCARTER: It is.\nHANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?\nSOLOMON: I do. I think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative. Sort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation. There are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks. There were also some personal business projects, some very senior Clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from Russia. It will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks. Another layer of interest of the story.\nHANNITY: All right. We have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here. Both of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents. I hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands. True or false?\nSOLOMON: That seems to be accurate. We have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous.\nHANNITY: Now let me go to Victoria. One of the great attorneys. She is the most difficult to get any information out of. Victoria, one of the things I\u2019ve known about you, and I\u2019ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this. You are now representing this FBI informant. I think they will become an American hero out of all of this, but apparently, he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the Russians are here, they are doing this, why are you paying attention? I hope my instincts are right there, and number two, how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what I was just asking Sara and John about impacting former Obama officials, money, Clinton foundation?\nVICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area. There\u2019s no separate companies. They are all related. The Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top, from Putin. They are all one. They all talk to each other. So the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn\u2019t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it \u2014\nHANNITY: Explain CFIUS, 13 agencies, I am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor, hostile regime, Putin Russia.\nTOENSING: They said, the CFIUS board said that the bad Russians could buy uranium one, which contains access to 20 percent of the U.S. Uranium, why was that decision made? Was CFIUS told? Did Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him? Eric Holder sat on it.\nHANNITY: He was one of the nine.\nTOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him? The FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct. Of course, when the CFIUS decision was made. My client said, what happened?\nHANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may. You are too good at your job. This is a very serious point. Putting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level? National security compromise?\nTOENSING: Of course, it goes without saying giving the Russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise. I think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.\nHANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I\u2019m not the only one thinking that. You have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both. I want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when. What did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon? I\u2019m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton.\nSOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don\u2019t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew. This person said without a shred of doubt, we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality, without a shadow of a doubt, we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market, get a strong hold on our uranium, and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here. We are talking about control, like this document says, they are trying to gain control of our markets. That has to be national security interest that should have been raised in CFIUS.\nHANNITY: President daily briefings were told. Had this information in it before CFIUS approves this.\nCARTER: Sean. That is what we need to find out. We need to see those Presidential daily briefings. Congress can get those. They will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was. I think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when. And we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board.\nHANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller? John, real quick, we are running out of time.\nSOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer. There are people in Congress who don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gotten a straight answer from them.\nHANNITY: All right. Victoria, we get the last word from you, laws broken?\nTOENSING: Well, of course.\nHANNITY: You are so good at your job. You are so annoyingly good. The American people deserve the truth varied our security was compromised, we import uranium, because we don\u2019t have enough.

The asteroid will pass within 6.5 million miles of the Earth, which is relatively close in space terms, but still around 27 times the distance of the moon. Much closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past.\nScientists at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape. First detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13. This would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January.\nThe main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition. Asteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material. Comets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.\nBut the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid\u2019s close approach to our planet. According to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies. It is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21.

I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d\nAlex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor\u2019s office told reporters the verdict \u201cwas not the one we were hoping for,\u201d but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just shocked \u2014 saddened and shocked ... that\u2019s about it,\u201d Jim Steinle, Kate\u2019s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way you can coin it.

No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.\u201d\nMexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times. In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation. San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national. On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.\nThe Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers. During the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate\u2019s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution. As Gonzalez argued, \u201cIf this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?\u201d\nThat sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family. The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years. Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\nSan Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.

No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2017\nUpdate 1: AP reports that U.S. immigration officials say they will deport the Mexican man found not guilty of murder in San Francisco pier shooting.\n* * *\nAs we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle.\nMr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico. He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.\nThe backlash to his release into the community crescendoed when Donald Trump invoked Ms. Steinle\u2019s killing as he campaigned for president.\nAs The New York Times reports, Ms. Steinle\u2019s death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status should be deported more aggressively, and over the role local law enforcement should play.\nMs. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father\u2019s arms.\nMr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.\nZarate and his defense team maintained the argument that the suspect found the stolen weapon on the pier that day and it \u201cjust fired.\u201d The gun belonged to a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger and was stolen from his parked car a week earlier. The bullet ricocheted on the pier\u2019s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her. Zarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.\nDefense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier\u2026 but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another\u2026\nHe said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged. But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal. He also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire.\nBut still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm.\nGarcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years.\n* * *\nThe public defender wasted no time in focusing his thoughts on President Trump and his administration\u2026saying Zarate was \u201cextremely relieved\u201d by the outcome and that while Steinle\u2019s death \u201cwas a horrible tragedy,\u201d it was used as \u201cpolitical fodder for then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration agenda.\u201d\nAdachi added, \u201cDespite the unfairly politicized atmosphere surrounding this case, jurors focused on the evidence, which was clear and convincing, and rendered a just verdict.\u201d\nIn a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California\u2019s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE.\n\u201cWhen jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public\u2019s safety at risk,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.\u201d Sessions continued, \u201cI urge the leaders of the nation\u2019s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.\u201d\nSocial media erupted with outrage at the verdict (with very few \u2013 if any attempting to defend the verdict)\u2026\nI don't know any American citizen who is a 5x felon and could get away with killing someone with a stolen gun. #KateSteinle #KatesLaw #JoseZarate \u2014 Ginger (@SpicyMustang) December 1, 2017\nI seriously feel like buying my own damn bricks & building this damn wall myself!

At issue is a large group of Indonesian Chinese Christians who fled a pogrom in Indonesia directed against them in the 1990s. The Chinese generally filed asylum applications after arriving in the United States, and, importantly, not at an American embassy or consulate in Indonesia or nearby. All were relatively wealthy and had or obtained tourist visas to the United States.\nThis is important as most actual \"refugees\" drop everything to flee their homelands if they are under threat of death. Tellingly, these asylum applicants were the elite of Indonesian society, because their higher average IQ, than the rather dull Indonesians.\n87 is the average Indonesian IQ , and note that average includes the higher average Chinese, so the locals really are a dull lot. This is important in that while there was anti-Chinese and anti-Christian violence, the non-Chinese Christians mostly stuck around, though the Chinese used tourist and student visas to come to the United States in a leisurely manner, taking time to either bring or otherwise secure their wealth in Indonesia. In any event, the persecution was limited in time and duration as the local elite know they need the Chinese to run the economy and to avoid Red China intervening on behalf of their fellow ethnics.\nIn the United States, these Chinese went through the liberal asylum process, but did not manage to fool even the credulous \"judges\" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts.\nFast forward to the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , where despite outstanding deportation orders, these illegal aliens, among millions of others, are allowed to remain, and then given employment authorization as well. Fortunately, elections have consequences, and the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty, or parts of it, came to an inglorious end. And end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens. But Kritarch Patti Saris was having none of the immigration laws of the United States. She thought she was decider-in-chief on who gets deported.\nAnd all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple, despite the clear fact that the Indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of Chinese and the religious motivated violence against Christians. While there are a couple of provinces in Indonesia that impose Sharia law on Muslims, most non-Muslims are exempt. As moderates go, Indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate Muslims. Mostly because the country would not last long without an outside high IQ elite to run the country. Before it was the high IQ Dutch, now it's the Chinese. Remember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded.\nA federal judge on Monday ordered U.S. immigration officials to delay any efforts to deport 51 Indonesians living illegally in New Hampshire so the group can have time to argue that changing conditions in that country would make it dangerous to return... Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts. Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United State. She worried that without the order, ICE officials could deport some of the Indonesians covered by the suit, at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened. [Judge Orders U.S. To Delay Deporting Indonesians In Immigration Fight, by Scott Malone, Reuters, November 27, 2017]\nKritarch Saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these Chinese illegal aliens. And now she has gone full rogue, prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration court.Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law.\n\u201cThe government shall inform the court whether petitioners, who are not detained, will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen,\u201d Saris wrote.\nThis makes no sense in English, much less in the established procedures in the EOIR. The aliens have no emergency, there are no emergency procedures, and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim.\nIndonesia is more hospitable to Chinese Christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem. But basically, Saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application, and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims. Basically Saris wants these illegals to never leave. That, of course is not her role. The only claim they have before a Federal court is if they got the due process that Congress gave those illegal aliens. And they did, they filed for asylum, had a hearing and appeals, and lost.\nWith the legislative fight over DACA, the Trump Administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy, as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration, build the wall, and deport illegals here.

There are no other interpretations.\"\nUntil now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State. The rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents\u2014the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines\u2014to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.\nHence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See.\nThe problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration. St. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\"\nThe fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it. Cardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:\nRescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\"\nThe Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.\nFrom the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017\nPietro Card. Parolin\nSecretary of State\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals. Some rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g. the interpretation of a law.\"\nIt appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals. Pope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?\nAs reported in The Dictator Pope\u2014a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history\u2014English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\" Each day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement.\nWe shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\"\nShould this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head. In an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\"\nBurke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["San Francisco Show Trial Sequel\nLast week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14. The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession. Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.\nSan Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate\u2019s gun possession charge dismissed. Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that \u201cmomentary\u201d possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime. \u201cIf you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime,\u201d Gonzalez told reporters. The Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.\nGonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship. As he explained, \u201cI think I was a product of affirmative action,\u201d and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School. In San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as \u201cThe Great Left Hope,\u201d and a hero to Bay Area radicals. The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA\u2019s most high-profile Stalinists.\nIn 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in \u201ctraffic cone orange.\u201d As Gonzalez explained, \u201cThis is a sentiment I think all of us have had. You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don\u2019t like.\u201d\nIn 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom. In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president. \u201cHe has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,\u201d Nader told reporters. On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.\nIn jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three \u201cimmigrants,\u201d quite possibly false-documented illegals. True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors. So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.\nGarcia told the court Zarate was playing his own \u201csecret version of Russian roulette,\u201d and thus parroted the defense\u2019s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance. As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.\nIn a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle. In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta. This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.\nGarcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands. After firing, he tossed the gun in the water. He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims. Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.\nAny observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted. Unlike Stalin\u2019s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro\u2019 trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.\nDenunciations of \u201cgun violence\u201d were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak. As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love. On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.\nIn the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what\u2019s best for all.

When the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?\u201d What then indeed? The Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord\u2019s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God\u2019s words: \u201cAnd lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],\u201d which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a \u201cnot a good translation.\u201d Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered m\u00e9lange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.\nBut now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy. The Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example. But never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions. By publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will. The guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis\u2019s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be \u201can apostolic letter.\u201d\nThe normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate. We are now expected to believe that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d\u2014meaning simply and only AL\u2014teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:\nWhen the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence\u2026.\nIn other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable. Nonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment\u2026. [I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf. 301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf. notes 336 and 351).\nAs Francis would have it, then, the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:\nThe admission of public adulterers in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called \u201c intrinsically impossible \u201d given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances\u2014that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.\nThe requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament\u2014a moral norm binding \u201c without exception \u201d because it is rooted in divine law\u2014is suddenly demoted to a mere \u201cproposal\u201d that may not be \u201cfeasible\u201d or \u201cviable\u201d in \u201cthe concrete circumstances of the couple.\u201d\nA valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in \u201cmore complex circumstances\u2026 when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,\u201d the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.\nThe meaningless slogan \u201cjourney of discernment\u201d cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church\u2019s sacramental life.\nNo less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a \u201cnew union,\u201d could be \u201cdamaged\u201d if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion\u2014evidently because the \u201cnew union\u201d would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!\nThis appeared in the last Print-Edition of The Remnant. See what else you missed. Subscribe Today!\nAs recently as seventeen years ago, during the reign of John Paul II, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915, which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those \u201cwho obstinately persist in manifest grave sin.\u201d That prohibition, declared the Pontifical Council, applies to the divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification, but rather \u201cis derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws; [and] the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church.\u201d\nFrancis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church. The attempt is void, of course, and the appellation \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d is fraudulent. But the consequences of this Pope\u2019s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half-baked theological notions, such as \u201cdiscernment\u201d (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.\nOver the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to \u201cclarify\u201d his intention respecting AL. That clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law. Even if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God\u2014an immoral law is no law at all\u2014Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat, daring invoke the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d to cloak his absurd novelties. No Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.\nSo now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops? With one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to\u2014at best\u2014hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to \u201cclarify\u201d his already perfectly clear intentions. At this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian \u201cclarification\u201d can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.\nContinued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge. Their failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.\nThe time for \u201cprudence\u201d is long past. Prudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity. The time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable. The members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber, when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage:\nWhere in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path? Where are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries, before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage? What we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.\nWill none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as \u201ca new Athanasius, a new Basil\u201d? Even the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the \u201cconfusion\u201d Francis has caused by not \u201cclarifying\u201d precisely what he has just clarified. They avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source. That error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self-evident cause\u2014a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition\u2014they seem incapable of identifying.\nConcerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations. But in the midst of that \u201cfinal battle\u201d over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima, within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage, family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now, for the first time in Church history, being led by a Roman Pontiff.\nThis undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs\u2014first and foremost in the Church\u2014the duty to act. True love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal. 2:11). May Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.

Iran is one of the only issues on which the U.S. president has remained relatively consistent.

Fortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.\nOn December 12, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell\u2019s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003. Haley\u2019s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.\n\u201cIf we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,\u201d Haley warned. \u201cThere is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cThe evidence is undeniable. The weapons might as well have had \u2018Made in Iran\u2019 stickers all over it.\u201d\nBuy Gold at Discounted Prices\nHowever, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.\nAs Common Dream\u2019s Reza Marashi explained:\n\u201cHaley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis. Of course, the UN has reached no such conclusion. Instead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have \u2018no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.\u2019 Asked about Haley\u2019s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the UN said, \u2018The info I have is less clear.\u2019 Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley\u2019s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles\u2019 origin. Perhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company. Did she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report? The world may never know.\u201d\nRegardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.\nRitter writes:\n\u201cThe missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean. The modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman. The UN panel claims not to have any evidence of \u2018external missile specialists\u2019 working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.\u201d [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them? According to Ritter:\n\u201cRather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings. The transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly. This is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.) The difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable. The increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile. The Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen\u2019s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers. In January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n\u201cThe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.\u201d [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley\u2019s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn\u2019t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington\u2019s schizophrenic approach to the region. Why is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy. According to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi\u2019s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own. Ritter explains further:\n\u201cIf a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today? The fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability. If the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility. No amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality. This is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.\u201d [emphasis added]\n", ["Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice"]], ["Apparently, They Think We are Fools\nAs Pope Francis continues his five-year-long tirade against the imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church\u2019s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline\u2014he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)\u2014he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment.\nDetermined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium\u00ae on his outrageous opinion that in \u201ccomplex circumstances\u201d wherein it is not \u201cfeasible\u201d to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined \u201cprocess of discernment.\u201d As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they \u201cdiscern\u201d that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.\nDo they think we are fools?\nThen there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal M\u00fcller. In a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione\u2019s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church\u2019s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, M\u00fcller proposed this preposterous \u201csolution\u201d to a \u201cproblem\u201d that does not exist:\nIt is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof. In this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.\nThe Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense. No Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when\u2014indeed because\u2014he lacks canonical proof of invalidity. Moreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported \u201csecond marriage\u201d can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery. Cardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church\u2019s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard:\nSuch cases do not exist. No priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum. Marriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church. If a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?\nThe only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live \u201cas brother and sister\u201d, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person. Even then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.\nDoes Cardinal M\u00fcller think we are fools? Some of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce \u201ca discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.\u201d\nApparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of \u201cmercy\u201d: the justification of contraception in \u201ccomplex cases\u201d to which \u201cdiscernment\u201d must be applied. Consider the recent declaration by one of Francis\u2019s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it. In a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a \u201cmoral theologian\u201d of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that \u201can artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.\u201d\nThat is, Francis\u2019s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept! Chiodi\u2019s sole \u201cauthority\u201d for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church. AL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium\u00ae products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of \u201cpastoral integration\u201d of homosexual unions.\nEvidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church. (Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which \u201cdefends the Faith\u201d while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church. Silence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.)\nBut we are not fools. And God will not be mocked. Francis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing. Meanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit.

All those arrested were men between the ages of 20 and 53.\nAliens arrested during this operation are from the following five countries: Ecuador (1), Honduras (2), Mexico (17), Serbia (1) and Ukraine (1).\nSix of the 22 arrested during this operation were criminal aliens who were released back into their communities after local law enforcement failed to honor an immigration detainer placed on the individuals by ICE. Immigration detainers request that ICE be notified before the individual is released from local custody for any reason.\nMost of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: sexual assault, kidnapping, assault, assault with a weapon, drug possession, theft, obstruction of justice and driving under the influence (DUI); two were known fugitive immigration violators, and six were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony.\nThe following are criminal summaries of the offenders arrested in Illinois during this operation:\nA 38-year-old Mexican citizen and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 8 in Rolling Meadows. He was previously convicted in Cook County for felony aggravated criminal sexual assault and bodily harm. He was previously deported. Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not honor the ICE detainer that was placed. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.\nA 37-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago. He was previously convicted twice of drug possession, and he has pending criminal charges for sexually assaulting a child. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.\nA 20-year-old Mexican man and a known gang member was arrested Jan. 7 in Round Lake Beach. He was previously convicted of battery. He is also Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient with two extensions. He was served a notice to appear before a federal immigration judge, and will remain in ICE custody pending disposition of his immigration proceedings.\nA 32-year-old previously deported Ecuadoran man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago. He has criminal convictions for DUI, domestic assault and assault. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.\nA 46-year-old previously deported Mexican man was arrested Jan. 7 in Chicago. He has a criminal conviction for possessing cocaine. He remains in ICE custody pending presentation of criminal prosecution for re-entry after deportation.\nDepending on an alien\u2019s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.\n\u201cOur dedicated officers strive to make our communities safer by arresting convicted criminal aliens and removing them from the United States despite the reckless sanctuary policies that are currently in place in Cook County that put our communities at risk,\u201d said Ricardo Wong, field office director of ERO Chicago. \u201cThis operation focused on targeting immigration fugitives and criminal aliens in two Illinois counties, but we routinely conduct operations daily.

There are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US, Russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn't belong and funding, training and arming Islamic jihadis there.\nThen, there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad .\nRT reports:\nRefugees in Europe are just \u201cMuslim invaders\u201d and economic migrants seeking better lives, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said, adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of \u2018parallel societies.\u2019 Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees, Orban replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider these people to be Muslim refugees.\u201d Instead, the tough-talking politician said they were regarded as \u201cMuslim invaders.\u201d Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach Hungary from Syria, all of which are not as rich as Germany but are economically stable, the PM said. He was apparently referring to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia \u2013 a common route for migrants heading for \u2018wealthy\u2019 Europe. \u201cSo, they are not running for their lives [in these countries]. They are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,\u201d Orban concluded. He stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d immigration. In his view, the government simply can\u2019t go against the will of the people.\nAnd Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country.\nRT continues:\nGoing further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany. \u201cThe reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,\u201d he said, describing the issue \u201cpolitically\u201d as a European problem but, \u201csociologically,\u201d as a German problem. Orban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u2018open-door\u2019 policy towards asylum seekers. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,\u201d he said. The recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban. \u201cIf someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: \u2018Can we come in, can we stay?\u2019 They [asylum seekers] didn\u2019t do that, they crossed the border illegally,\u201d he stated.\nOrban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism. He called it an \"illusion\" and said that Christian and Muslim societies \u201cwill never unite.\u201d\nOf course, they won't. They have absolutely nothing in common. They cannot agree on God's law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States. They cannot agree on the Scriptures. They cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ. They can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.\nPM Orban has remained consistent.\nHe has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back.\nHe has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has.\nOrban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!\nHe has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, \"That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.\"\nFurthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros.\nAnti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, \"At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe.

And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\u201d\nBased on what the FBI knew \u2013 including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money \u2013 the Uranium One deal never should have gone through. Moreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved \u2013 and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them.\nIn short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry.\nThe informant \u2013 outed as energy consultant William Campbell \u2013 was \u201cthreatened\u201d by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron-clad gag order, according to his attorney \u2013 former Reagan Justice Dept. official and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing. After Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:\n\u201cAttorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex\u2019s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration.

Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill. \u201cIt is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed. I hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,\u201d added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general\u2019s first response to the committee \u201clargely missed the point\u201d of the congressional investigations. \u201cThe essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,\u201d Grassley scolded.\u201d\nMeanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant\u2019s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand.\n\u201cBy the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI\u2019s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia\u2019s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,\u201d Carter writes.\nHighlights:\nFBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset \u2013 paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell\u2019s attorney says they thanked him for his service.\nCampbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money \u2013 which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \u201cnuclear money laundering apparatus\u201d\nCampbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period\nCampbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes \u201cRussia\u2019s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,\u201d an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding \u201cThis should raise serious questions. At the time everyone was concerned about Russia\u2019s ties to Iran, we still are.

The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:\nYou do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet). If Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic? Do not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives? Islam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know? How is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence? \u201cWhat is the relationship between Christ and Satan? What union is there between light and darkness? What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?\u201d (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life. Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?\nThe letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:\nIn fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything. As a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: \u201cBetween us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!\u201d (Qur\u2019an 60.4) For the Qur\u2019an, Christians \u201care only impurity\u201d (Quran 9.28),\u201d \u201cthe worst of Creation\u201d (Qur\u2019an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur\u2019an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30). We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5). Where the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the \u201cinfidels\u201d in exchange for his paradise: \u201cThey fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.\u201d (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you \u201cdialogue\u201d means the voice of peace, for Islam it\u2019s only another way to make war. Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naivet\u00e9 in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous. How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: \u201cTo wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (\u2026) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran. \u201c(Rome, January 20, 2014)? That the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry? Should we return to Islam?\nThe authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle \u201cagainst the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world\u201d because \u201cthey share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).\u201d They contest the idea that speaking in an \u201cIslamophilic tone\u201d will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that \u201capart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).\u201d\nThe letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who \u201cdo not welcome any refugee\u201d while Pope Francis preaches\nthe welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: \u201cIf anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him. Whoever greets him participates in his evil works.\u201d (2 John 1.10-11); \u201cIf anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!\u201d (Galatians 1.8-9)\nThe signatories go on to give voice to the utter scandal of the pope\u2019s failure to carry out his evangelical mission as the Vicar of Christ to call home the members of the Islamic faith:\nThe pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam \u2026 Thus ignorant souls are misled\u2026\nTaking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope\u2019s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians\nnot preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No. 57). We are under the impression that you do not take your brother Bishop Nona Amel, Chaldean-Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in exile, seriously, when he tells us: \u201cOur present sufferings are the prelude to those that you, Europeans and Western Christians, will suffer in the near future. I have lost my diocese. The headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die. (\u2026) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims. You are in danger as well. You must make strong and courageous decisions (\u2026). You think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal. (\u2026) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.\u201d (August 9, 2014) \u201c. This is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous. We do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it. Where then would we go to seek refuge?\nThe signatories plea is that the pope will \u201cquickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.\u201d\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["We Should Be More Like Sweden: Gov May Use Army Against Immigrant Gangs\nProgressives say we should be more like Sweden.

Fernando Karadima who has been found guilty of sexually abusing a slew of minors as a member of the Catholic Church.\nPope Francis accused victims of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile of slander Thursday, an astonishing end to a visit meant to help heal the wounds of a sex abuse scandal that has cost the Catholic Church its credibility in the country.

Fernando Karadima, such accusations against Barros are \u201call calumny.\u201d The pope\u2019s remarks drew shock from Chileans and immediate rebuke from victims and their advocates.

There is not a single piece of evidence against him. It is all calumny. Is that clear?\u201d\nThis month has been quite a spectacle, even for this pontificate; an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments, with the pope and his Vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next. But among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the Bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in \u201ccalumny,\u201d in their accusations against a Chilean bishop, Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid.\nIt seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists, his natural constituency. Writing for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, \u201cLet the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018\u2026 he has revealed himself like no one else could.\u201d\nBut it gets worse than this. When a \u201cleftist\u201d pope pressing a secularist agenda on the Church starts to lose the support of Michael Sean Winters and the National Catholic Reporter, he must know he\u2019s in trouble. Though he\u2019s \u201csticking with Francis\u201d for now, Winters wrote, \u201cI wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church. I am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop\u2019s resignation.\u201d\nOn January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, \u201cWithin the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.\u201d\n\u201cThese remarks are at the least shameful. At the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up. The script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors\u2019 testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else.\n\u201cThe insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying. Three separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him. The second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman. As she spoke to the pope, her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church\u2019s top leader. She asked: \u2018Why are not the victims\u2019 testimonies proof for you? Why do you not believe them?\u2019 The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of \u2018no evidence\u2019 against the bishop.\u201d\nIndeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis\u2019 trip to Latin America \u2013 dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope\u2019s appearances and in the press \u2013 was in part intended as \u201can apology tour\u201d to abuse survivors. Which is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio\u2019s ability to turn on a dime.\nAll was going as planned. On Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests. He made all the right noises, talking about his \u201cpain and shame,\u201d and reportedly even crying, at what happened. \u201cI know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil,\u201d he said.\n24 hours later he was calling them liars.\nJames Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers. He told the BBC at a press conference, \u201cWhat the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.\u201d The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis\u2019s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, \u201cDoes he need a photo, a selfie, as proof? Sorry Austen, we didn\u2019t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.\u201d\nAlthough the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015. Barros was a student prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the charismatic homosexual/pederast predator Fernando Karadima, and went on to be ordained in 1984, made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces.\nBarros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima\u2019s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010. This is refuted by Karadima\u2019s victims \u2013 deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal \u2013 who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.\nLast Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults. In 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter\u2019s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the \u201csuffering\u201d of the Church in Chile over the issue.\nThe pope told the women, \u201cThe Church has lost its freedom, letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof, after twenty years of service, so think with your head.\u201d He warned them not to allow themselves to be led by \u201cleftists who have set up this thing.\u201d\n\u201cThe only charge against this bishop has been discredited by the Court of Justice, so please do not lose your serenity, you suffer, but because you are foolish...I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes, but in this case there is not even a proof.\u201d\nThe insults were not forgotten. Among the signs held by protesters in Chile last week were those reading, \u201cNi zurdos, ni tontos,\u201d (Neither lefties nor stupid). The jab certainly wasn\u2019t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport. One of the protesters told the BBC, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things? He thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.\u201d\nApparently His Holiness was informed that the \u201ccalumny\u201d comment had caused some blow-back because a couple of days later we got something touted \u2013 though somewhat skeptically \u2013 as a \u201ccontrite\u201d papal apology. This also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O\u2019Malley \u2013 a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope\u2019s sex abuse commission \u2013 who said, \u201cIt is understandable that Pope Francis\u2019 statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.\u201d\n\u201cPope Francis fully recognizes the egregious failures of the Church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\nOf course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was. \u201cI have to ask forgiveness because the word \u2018proof\u2019 wounded,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wounded many people who were abused\u2026I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound. And this horrified me a lot, because I had received them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face \u2018bring me a letter, a proof.\u2019 It\u2019s a slap. And I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\nHe doubled down, saying, \u201cI have not heard any victim of Barros. They did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court. It\u2019s all in the air. It is true that Barros was in Karadima\u2019s group of young people. But let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what I can say with sincerity. Barros will remain there if I don\u2019t find a way to condemn him. I cannot condemn him if I don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t say proof \u2013 but evidence. And there are many ways to get evidence. Is that clear?\u201d\nThis \u201ccontrite\u201d papal apology didn\u2019t fly well even with the regular news reporters. Philip Pullela, a reporter on the plane for Reuters, described it as \u201can extremely rare act of self-criticism,\u201d for the \u201cunusually contrite\u201d Bergoglio, and noted that, \u201cWhile the pope has vowed \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for sexual abuse, his efforts have sputtered.\u201d\nIndeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the \u201cpain\u201d of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand. CBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused. Greg Burke, the pope\u2019s press officer, confirmed that \u201cno papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.\u201d\nWho is Barros?\nSome may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop. At the time it didn\u2019t draw much attention from the English language press \u2013 mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods. But despite the pope\u2019s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge.\nHe is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the \u201880s and \u201890s. In fact \u2013 and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press \u2013 Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima. This is not, therefore, merely a matter of a bishop or colleague discovering the abuse after the fact, but of being a voyeuristic participant.\nJuan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy \u2013 both in their teens at the time \u2013 \u201cwould lie down on the priest\u2019s [Karadima\u2019s] bed, one resting his head at the man\u2019s shoulder, another sitting near his feet. The priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev. Juan Barros watched.\u201d Cruz, now a 51-year-old \u201cgay\u201d journalist, told The Associated Press, \u201cBarros was there, and he saw it all.\u201d\nA Vatican investigation found Karadima guilty in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of seclusion in a monastery for \u201cpenitence and prayer.\u201d Note that date; 2011 was when the processes for investigating and trying priest-abusers, put in place by the former Cardinal Ratzinger, were still in effect, and while he was still sitting on the Petrine throne. Things are a bit different now.\nNeither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people. The media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment \u2013 none of which received any response. Fr. Peter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, \u201cWe\u2019re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded. We need a bishop who\u2019s credible.\u201d\nThe problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis\u2019s C9 inner council. It was certainly never a secret that Err\u00e1zuriz was a close, like-minded friend and collaborator of then-Cardinal Bergoglio, the kingpin of South American Catholicism.\nAllegations against Karadima \u2013 that went back to 1962 \u2013 had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Err\u00e1zuriz. Even the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,\n\u201cHamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque. His wife confided in a priest, who told Err\u00e1zuriz in 2006. When a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled. Again, Err\u00e1zuriz refused to take action against Karadima.\u201d\nThe pope\u2019s claim that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case \u2013 a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican\u2019s own rules for determining credibility in such cases. While Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible. After a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims \u201ctruthful and reliable\u201d. Victims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima\u2019s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Err\u00e1zuriz\u2019s successor and collaborator.\nAs for Barros\u2019s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning. In a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship. \u201cI saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other. The groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros\u2019 genitals\u201d. Barros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima. Hamilton confirmed this saying, \u201cI saw how Barros watched it all.\u201d\nAnd the matter didn\u2019t end in 2010. Emails published in Chile in 2015 showed that Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz also blocked the appointment of Juan Carlos Cruz from the new child protection commission \u2013 a group plagued by such scandals and eventually ignored to death by Francis.\nWhich brings us to Francis Bergoglio\u2019s own record in this area. The pope claimed \u201cI am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,\u201d but this claim is not supported by the reality. Indeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at \u201csafeguarding\u201d young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up.\nIn the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that \u201creveals the [Chilean] bishops\u2019 concern about Francis naming a Karadima prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Bishop Juan Barros.\u201d Just days before the pope\u2019s \u201ccalumny\u201d comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno. \u201c[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.\u201d\nThe letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, said, \u201cThank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros. I understand what you\u2019re telling me and I\u2019m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you\u2019ve had to undergo.\u201d The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had \u201cencouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.\u201d\nThere can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima\u2019s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council. And even if he didn\u2019t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role. Francis further appointed Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in June 2014.\nSince 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes. Among the earliest indications Catholics had that the new pope had no intention of getting to the bottom of the priest-abuser problem was his appointment of the notorious homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, as head of the Vatican Bank and the man in charge of his own residence, the Casa Santa Martha.\nIt is often forgotten that Bergoglio\u2019s notorious comment \u201cwho am I to judge\u201d was in response to a question on a plane-presser about Ricca, and was followed with a similar claim from Francis about there having been no proof of his misbehaviour. As the pseudonymous Marcantonio Colonna wrote in the book, \u201cThe Dictator Pope,\u201d \u201cIn fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.\u201d\nBut even before this was the sinister appearance of Godfried Cardinal Danneels on the loggia on the night of Francis\u2019s election to the papacy. Danneels\u2019s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope\u2019s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse. The former head of the Brussels archdiocese was a leading figure in the so-called St. Gallen Group, which he himself described as a \u201cmafia,\u201d who had worked against the election of Joseph Ratzinger in 2005 and to elect Bergoglio in 2013.\nAt the end of a long career as Europe\u2019s leading \u201cliberal\u201d Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew. In 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges. The cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should \u201cask forgiveness\u201d for his own role in the scandal. Before the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups.\nIn the book, Colonna asks the question, \u201cWhat happened to \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 for clerical sexual offenders?\u201d He wrote that data presented by the Vatican the UN Human Rights Commission in January 2014 showed that Benedict XVI \u201chad defrocked or suspended more than 800 priests for past sexual abuse between 2009 and 2012,\u201d including the notorious Fr. Maciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ. Crucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders.\nHis reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers. A senior member of the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, \u201cThis Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world... There have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.\u201d\nThese reforms \u2013 and removals \u2013 have ceased entirely under Francis. Despite his claims that he punishes the guilty, it was in fact Francis who reversed the previous, Benedict-era sentence against the notorious Italian priest-pederast Mario Inzoli at the request of the now-equally notorious Cardinal Coccopalmerio. Inzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.\nInzoli had even abused boys in the confessional, convincing them that the abuse was approved by God. Following an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest\u2019s penalty to a \u201clifetime of prayer,\u201d with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children. The uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized.\nAs for Ratzinger/Benedict\u2019s procedural reforms, rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well, placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001. This has been denied by Greg Burke, but given Francis\u2019s usual methods, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who in reality is actually dealing with these cases, if anyone. A tribunal of bishops, requested by his own sex abuse commission, was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases, famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal M\u00fcller who was soon to be dismissed.\nIn fact, the chaos and lack of commitment on the issue has come under harsh criticism from at least one member of the pope\u2019s now-defunct sex abuse commission, a loudly trumpeted part of Bergoglio\u2019s early scheme of reform. Marie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor, was appointed in 2014 to the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. She resigned in 2017, citing \u201cVatican officials\u2019 reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children.\u201d Collins released a damning statement, indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything. She said none of the commission\u2019s recommendations had been implemented.\n\u201cThe reluctance of some in the Vatican Curia to implement recommendations or cooperate with the work of a commission when the purpose is to improve the safety of children and vulnerable adults around the world is unacceptable,\u201d Collins wrote. As of December last year, the commission has been allowed to lapse, and no longer functions, though it has not been definitively dissolved. The terms of office of its members expired December 17th.\nThis week Collins tweeted her question for Pope Francis on the Chilean situation: \u201cWhy does the Pope not believe these three men? They have been consistent over years in what they say. When asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not the survivors he can give no good reason.\u201d\nWhy indeed.\n", ["Conversation_Killer", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion"]], ["Conspiracy: Muslim Photographer & Nation Of Islam Hid Photos Of Obama With Farrakhan Since 2008\nThe left-wing enemedia worked as furiously to cover up, censor and sanction Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s jihad and violent left-wing connections as they do to manufacture and make up lies to destroy President Trump.\nThe LA Times refused to release a video of the infamous Jew-hating event Obama hosted with close confidante and infamous antisemite Rashid Khalidi.\nThe media gave scant coverage to Obama\u2019s close relationship with radical Reverend Jeremiah \u201cGod damn America) Wright who blamed the US for 9/11.\nI detailed Obama\u2019s nefarious connections and resulting worldview in my book, The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration\u2019s War on America , which was ignored by the mainstream media.\nThe Muslim photographer Askia Muhammad, who took this photo of candidate Barack Obama and vicious jihad-supporting racist Louis Farrakhan, knew this would impact the election: he said so.\nAnd so he conspired with the terror group, the Nation of Islam, to keep it hidden for 10 years.\nHe has served as the editor of Muhammad Speaks and as the head of the Washington office of The Final Call, the official newspapers of the Nation of Islam.[4][5] He has worked as a commentator for National Public Radio and a columnist for Washington Informer.[6][7] (Wikipedia)\nThe photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d\u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said.

Obama recollects Farrakhan\u2019s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses. Farrakhan\u2019s eventual failure suggests to Obama that\u2019s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own.\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award.\nObama\u2019s \u201cspiritual advisor\u201d Rev. Jeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church\u2019s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn\u2019t make the press until the following year.\nSimilarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama\u2019s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko\u2019s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali. But after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?\nReading Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Man who sold ammo to Las Vegas gunman speaks out\n\u00a9 Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. Douglas Haig\nNew documents reveal the name of the second person of interest in the Las Vegas shooting. Police believe Douglas Haig may have conspired with gunman Stephen Paddock, but it's unclear if he's still under investigation. Haig sold Paddock ammunition the month before the October attack that killed 58 people dead and wounded hundreds of others.\nMandalay Bay hotel staff had numerous run-ins with Vegas gunman: companyLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock had lost money, been depressed, sheriff says\nHaig was contacted one day after the attack, after investigators found an Amazon box with his address on it inside Paddock's hotel room, reports CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. But Haig says he had no idea what Paddock was planning to do when he met him just a few weeks before the massacre.\nHaig says he sold Paddock 720 rounds of ammunition from Haig's home gun business. \"I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,\" he said. \"He told me exactly what he wanted. I handed him a box with the ammunition in it, and he paid me and he left.\" The rounds he sold are called \"tracer ammunition\" \u2013 bullets that leave a visible trail when fired. \"He said he was going to go put on a light show. And I can't remember whether he said for or with his friends, but that's what he did say,\" Haig said.\nBut newly released search warrant records filed last fall by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department say Haig \"may have conspired with Stephen Paddock to commit murder with a deadly weapon.\" Haig strongly denies that. \"I felt that they were hoping that they could find a connection between myself and Paddock, that would go back showing that I supplied him with most of his ammunition, possibly even some firearms,\" Haig said. \"They're not gonna find it. I talked to the guy three times.\" It's unclear whether Haig is still a person of interest, but he was the only one mentioned by name in the search warrant, other than Marilou Danley - Paddock's girlfriend. Authorities have since said they don't plan to bring charges against Danley.\nLas Vegas gunman's motive still unknown\nHaig does not blame himself, but within weeks of the massacre, he still decided to shut down his business. \"I'm still racking my brain for what did I miss. Why didn't I pick this up?\" he said. Haig, represented by his Phoenix attorneys Marc Victor and Andrew Marcantel, has not been charged. His attorneys say he continues to cooperate with investigators.

Records relating to Paddock were not being provided.\nThe records were released Wednesday in response to a public records lawsuit filed by The Associated Press and Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nHaig was named as a \"person of interest\" in the investigation by mistake Tuesday when court documents were released nearly four months after the shooting.\nThe documents did not disclose why authorities considered Haig a person of interest, and officials haven't said whether he has since been cleared of that designation.\nVictor said his client sold ammunition to Paddock once and doesn't believe they have communicated since.\n\"He is as connected (to Paddock) as the guy who sold him a hamburger for lunch,\" Victor said.\nLas Vegas police and officials with the FBI, U.S. attorney's office in Nevada and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives each declined Wednesday to comment about Haig or the investigation.\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press in October that Paddock bought 1,000 rounds of tracer ammunition from a private seller he met at a Phoenix gun show three weeks before the shooting. The official spoke anonymously because they weren't authorized to disclose case information.\nTracer bullets contain a pyrotechnic charge that illuminates the path of fired bullets so shooters can see whether their aim is correct.\nHaig told the AP on Tuesday that he sold unspecified ammunition to Paddock.\nHe also told \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday that he sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Paddock.\n\"I couldn't detect anything wrong with this guy,\" he said of Paddock.\nThe ammunition sale took place at Haig's home in Mesa, because he didn't have all the ammunition on hand that Paddock wanted while at the gun show.\nVictor said a box that Paddock used to carry ammunition out of Haig's house and bore his client's name was later found in the Las Vegas hotel where the attack was launched.\nIt's unknown whether the ammunition Haig sold to Paddock was used in the attack.\nThe lawyer said the type and quantity of ammunition Paddock bought from his client wasn't unusual.\nRobert Spitzer, an expert on firearms and the Second Amendment, said by and large there are no restrictions on the amount of ammunition a person can buy, but a large sale of tracer ammunition would certainly be unusual.\nOnly six states in the U.S. have laws requiring that ammunition buyers pass a background check. Arizona and Nevada do not have such a requirement, nor do they mandate that dealers keep a record of ammunition transactions.\n\"If you are in the business of selling anything, you are usually happy to make the sale, and there's nothing that says you need to write down this person's name or report the sale,\" said Spitzer, who is the chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland.\nVictor said his client has cooperated with investigators who contacted him within 24 hours of the shooting and has spoken to them probably four or five times, though he hasn't talked to them in months.\nHaig describes himself as a senior engineer for Honeywell Aerospace in his biography on the professional and social media platform LinkedIn.\nRecords show Haig also owns Specialized Military Ammunition LLC. The company's website says it sold tracer and incendiary ammunition but is now \"closed indefinitely.\"\nHaig's name was blacked out in the more than 270 pages of search warrant records released by a Nevada judge to the AP, but remained on one page of documents provided to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nThe newspaper published the name online. Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish later ordered the full document not be published without redactions, but she acknowledged she couldn't order the newspaper to retract the name.\nHaig plans to hold a news conference Friday to discuss his interaction with Paddock.\nGarcia Cano reported from Las Vegas.

India wants to tackle both those firsts in one fell swoop this year, with its Chandrayaan-2 mission, a trio of orbiter, lander and rover that would represent the country's second visit to the moon.\nThe mission is scheduled to launch sometime in the first half of this year, no earlier than March. Its target is a patch of lunar surface about 370 miles away from the south pole, where scientists think the rock may be 4 billion years old, formed just after the moon's giant ocean of liquid rock began to solidify.\nThe region is an area NASA would also like to visit, preferably with a robot that would bring souvenir rock home to Earth for scientists to analyze directly in the laboratory. But despite NASA's renewed focus on lunar exploration, as dictated in December by an order from President Trump, the agency won't beat India back to the moon.\nDibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images\nThat's even after India's Chandrayaan-2 mission was delayed by three years after Russia backed out of designing and producing the mission's lander.

Nowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran\u2019s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.\nWhen it comes to Iran\u2019s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy. \u201cWe are restoring clarity about our adversaries,\u201d Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were. Trump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia. \u201cWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,\u201d he stated, \u201cI did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\u201d\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging d\u00e9tente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic. His administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election. Some have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change. It was only downhill from there.\nIn a misguided effort to secure Iran\u2019s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink. He tried selling the American people on the na\u00efve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen. The tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.\nRansom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran. Promising criminal investigations targeting Iran\u2019s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down. Targeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel\u2019s intentions. Iranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.\nObama\u2019s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America\u2019s national security and weakened its image on the international stage. Worse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama\u2019s groveling.\nIran\u2019s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant. Iran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz. In addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America\u2019s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence. On the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual. On his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity. At times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships. The navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, \u201cunsafe and unprofessional.\u201d\nIranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island. The RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors. Ironically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn\u2019t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.\nBut according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude. In fact, Iran\u2019s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic Republic.\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that \u201cIran [was] playing with fire\u201d and added that he wouldn\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d to the mullahs as Obama was. This wasn\u2019t empty rhetoric. It was backed up by tangible action. Additional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231. Sanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism. Trump\u2019s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama. Most importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented. Those modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.\nThe mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn\u2019t ask \u201chow high\u201d when they say \u201cjump.\u201d Clearly, the IRGC\u2019s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization.\n", ["Flag_Waving", "Guilt_by_Association", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Ammo seller to Las Vegas killer arrested on federal charge\n(CNN) Douglas Haig, an Arizona man who says he sold tracer ammunition to the gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.\nA criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.

Tracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.\nHaig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing. Victor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\"\nBut in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.\nIt's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.

In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church\u2019s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.\nThey presented their profession \u201cbefore God who will judge us,\u201d in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops\u2019 conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis\u2019 apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia. Some of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give \u201cimplicit approval\u201d of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage.\nSuch a reading is causing \u201crampant confusion,\u201d will spread \u201ca plague of divorce\u201d in the Church, and is \u201calien\u201d to the Church\u2019s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession.\n\u201cThis is contrary to Divine Revelation,\u201d Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the \u201cbeautiful explanations\u201d that are being presented to clergy and faithful as \u201cdiscernment\u201d and \u201cpastoral accompaniment,\u201d or a \u201cchange of paradigm\u201d and \u201cdiscovery of the subjective part of the truth,\u201d when translated into \u201ccommon sense language,\u201d are tantamount to an allowance to sin.\n\u201cOur conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,\u201d Schneider explained. \u201cWe were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.\u201d\nAs Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they \u201ccould not act in another way.\u201d\nBishop Marian Eleganti\nThe profession\u2019s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995.\nIn July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery. The Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines.\nIn 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland. He was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010.\nSince 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops\u2019 Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities. He is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers.\nBishop Marian Eleganti\u2019s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine. To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria; and His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion"]], ["Conspiracy Theorists Seize on Mesa Man Who Sold Ammo to Las Vegas Shooter\nThanks to crackpots online, a Mesa man has become embroiled in conspiracy theories after he sold ammunition to the Las Vegas mass shooter.\nDouglas Haig, a 55-year-old Honeywell engineer, sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock in September. Haig's name was inadvertently revealed this week when unredacted court documents were released to reporters. Search warrant records showed that Haig was a person of interest in the investigation of the mass shooting.\nAs a result, Haig said that he has received death threats and people have pounded on his door to tell him that he deserves to die. \"It makes me feel horrible,\" he said at a news conference Friday morning. \"People need to do their research and think rather than just react viscerally.\u201d\nIt's not just people harassing Haig at his home: Conspiracy theorists online have seized on Haig's engineering background to lob wild claims about the Las Vegas shooting. Many of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman.\nBonkers conspiracy site Intellihub posted an article this week that pointed to Haig's background in the aerospace industry as a sign of U.S. government involvement in the massacre. They noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013.\n\"Let\u2019s not forget that it is a fact that helicopters were lurking behind the Mandalay Bay during the attack which were not shown on the radar,\" author Shepard Ambellas writes. Ambellas claims helicopters provided an \"air assault\" during the massacre, a ludicrous theory he's expounded upon on InfoWars with the internet's conspiracy-theorist-in-chief Alex Jones.\nAmbellas and Intellihub claim that the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are providing cover for the real story behind the massacre, with help from Haig.\nIn public statements this week, Haig denied any connection to the massacre and said he merely sold Paddock the rounds. \"However, don\u2019t be fooled,\" Intellihub writes. \"Haig is likely a CIA cut-out who is just upholding the public narrative in conjunction with the FBI Las Vegas and the LVMPD.\"\nLaura Loomer, a noxious far-right personality who formerly worked for Project Veritas, also started making hay with Haig's background in Arizona aerospace. She wrote on Twitter that the massacre \"is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day.\"\nDouglas Haig\u2019s @LinkedIn Account says he also has \u201cDOD Top secret clearance\u201d on top of specializing in military ammunition.\nHe is the second suspect in the #LasVegasShooting.\nThis is starting to look more and more like a gun running operation gone wrong every day. pic.twitter.com/ifkkglZ4kw \u2014 Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) January 30, 2018\nBut Haig is an engineer, and he says he's not a former military officer. It should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see. Had Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible.\nHaig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition \u2014 the bullets are legal in Arizona.\nPaddock showed up to buy ammunition at Haig's home after meeting him at a gun show in Phoenix. \"I sold him 600 rounds of .308 tracer, surplus U.S. military. I sold him 120 rounds of .556 tracer, again, surplus U.S. military,\" Haig said to ABC15. \"I put it in a box for him. He paid me, put it in his car, and left.\"\nHaig said he's been legally selling ammunition as as a hobby since 1991, but after the massacre, he has stopped his side business. It wasn't unusual for a customer to buy over 700 rounds, he said. \"I've seen all kinds of people. There were no tells,\" Haig said of Paddock.\nWhen asked about the threats, Haig said, \u201cI\u2019ve had people screaming they want me to die through my front door.\"\nHaig and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the conspiracy theorizing. Haig said he's sorry that the massacre took place, but emphasized that he had nothing to do with Paddock's mass shooting.\n\u201cI had no contribution to what Paddock did,\u201d Haig said at the news conference. \u201cI had no way to see into his mind. The product that I sold him had absolutely nothing to do with what he did.\u201d\nNevertheless, it's hard to believe that Haig's denials will dissuade the conspiracy-mongers.\nYouTube conspiracy theorist Jake Morphonios said that for all he knows, Doug Haig didn't play a role in Paddock's massacre. Even so, Morphonious still parlayed an innocent-until-proven-guilty stance into a 30-minute dissertation where he discussed a \"shadow government in the United States\" in the context of Haig's work for companies like Northrop Grumman.\n\"Did he know something that Stephen Paddock was going to do? That I don't know \u2014 it's possible, but who knows.\" Morphonious said.

(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino)\nIn a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis\u2019s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies.\nOn Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled \u201cFrancis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.\u201d As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited. Having followed Douthat and Faggioli\u2019s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.\nIn his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis\u2019s papacy thus far: his impact on the public\u2019s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on \u201cmoral-theological controversies,\u201d specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFaggioli, meanwhile, outlined a genuinely surprising position. Rather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of \u201ccontinuity\u201d with past popes, since doing so would assume that \u201cChristianity at some point . . . was complete,\u201d which Faggioli does not think is true.\nWhile I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy. Instead, through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism, he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.\nDuring the crux of the debate \u2014 the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried \u2014 Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point. To defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce. For Faggioli, the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it. This, he says, is \u201cbad for evangelization,\u201d and in order to keep the pews full, the Church\u2019s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried, but instead to ask, \u201cWhat can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThis is a lovely suggestion, and one that I\u2019m not entirely unsympathetic to. However, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful. Just before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world. But rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church\u2019s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.\nAdvertisement\nIt should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd. If the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church? Pope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of \u201caccommodation\u201d Faggioli is calling for, writing that when \u201cthe people cannot cope\u201d with God, they \u201cbring him down into their own world,\u201d and insist that \u201che must be the kind of God that [they need].\u201d In other words, \u201cMan is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.\u201d To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf.\nUnsurprisingly, this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism. Throughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.\nEventually, Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question: Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion? After a few seconds\u2019 pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: \u201cThere are different responses to the same question in different times.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThroughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of \u201cthe flock.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIt strikes me, however, that everybody \u2014 Catholic or not \u2014 has a dog in this fight, which is about more than communion and canon law. At its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong. Could we possibly say, for instance, that it\u2019s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents? Of course not \u2014 that would be preposterous, as I\u2019m sure Faggioli would agree.\nTo pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries. Whether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse. If we don\u2019t, we will find ourselves, in the words of Pope Benedict, in \u201ca dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one\u2019s own ego and desires.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nREAD MORE:\nA Defense of the Catholic Tradition\nThe Left\u2019s New Plan to Gut Religious-Liberty Protections\nWhat\u2019s At Stake in the Fight For Religious Freedom\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Illegal alien wanted for attempted murder in NC arrested at US-Mexico border\nTUCSON, Ariz. \u2013 While patrolling east of Nogales, Border Patrol agents assigned to the Nogales Station arrested Francisco Lopez-Loyola, a 38-year-old Mexican national for being illegally present in the United States Thursday.\nDuring processing, a records check indicated Lopez had an extraditable warrant from Catawba County, North Carolina for attempted first degree murder.

Yet, the party keeps on inviting an imam, who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals, to participate at its annual functions. This blatant hypocrisy shows the political bankruptcy of their leadership\u2019s claims to be pro-gay and anti-bigotry and reveals their intention to pander to those in the Muslim community who spew intolerance and would wish others harm.\nOn Saturday, October 7, 2017, the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson (TKJ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel, in West Palm Beach, Florida. The Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe. Other speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party.\nPrior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam. The imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals.\nShafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida. The mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity. \u201cDirty Bomber\u201d Jose Padilla was a student of Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s at Darul Uloom. Now-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom. And Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory.\nWhile terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque\u2019s history \u2013 and he has been around for all of it \u2013 Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.\nOne stop on Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover. The book is \u201cThe Meaning of THE HOLY QUR\u2019AN,\u201d a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries. In it, Jews are described as: \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cjealous,\u201d \u201cselfish,\u201d \u201cspiteful,\u201d \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201ccursed,\u201d \u201capes and swine,\u201d and \u201cunder divine displeasure.\u201d\nThis may seem an innocent mistake on the imam\u2019s part, but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but.\nIn February 2005, an article written by Shafayat Mohamed was published on the Darul Uloom website, entitled \u2018Tsunami: Wrath of God.\u2019 In it, he claims that gay sex caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and that most Jews and Christians, whom he refers to as \u201cPeople of the Book,\u201d are \u201cperverted transgressors.\u201d\nIt is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards. Even so, the imam has been unrepentant.\nIn a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled \u2018Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,\u2019 he admitted that he \u201cgot sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, \u2018We don\u2019t want him on that board.\u2019\u201d He said he had a choice, to \u201csit in Paradise or\u2026 sit on the board and go to Hell.\u201d\nHe began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage. He asked the following, \u201cDid you hear what President Obama said?\u2026 Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?... Here you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?\u2026 Are we sleeping? Do you believe in the Quran? Are we gonna sit and have the Quran be ridiculed?\u201d He then cited the Christian and Jewish Bible, barking loudly, \u201cThe Bible says that if a man sleeps with a man, he should be killed!\u201d\nShafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals. He decried, \u201cListen. Don\u2019t deny it. They already got Muslim gay communities.\u201d He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States. He exclaimed, \u201cHere the President says a man can marry a man, but you can\u2019t say a man can have four wives\u2026!\u201d\nThe October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in.

The profession was made public on Jan. 2, 2018.\nIn the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church\u2019s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are civilly divorced and joined in a second union may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.\nOrdained to the priesthood in 1961, Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990. After serving as vicar general of the diocese from 1989, in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Felkirch where he served until 2011, retiring at the age of 75.\nBishop Fischer\u2019s support of the profession comes one week after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world\u2019s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.\n\u201cGod decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,\u201d Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.\nSchneider said greater public support of the document from the world\u2019s 5,000 bishops would be \u201ca stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.\u201d\nBishop Fischer\u2019s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal.\nTo date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession:\n\u2022 Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia\n\u2022 Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 of Italy and former apostolic nuncio to the United States\n\u2022 His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy\n\u2022 Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria\n\u2022 His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA\n\u2022 His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur, Switzerland\n\u2022 His Excellency Elmar Fischer, Bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria.\n", ["Loaded_Language"]], ["Dem Congressman Praises Hitler-Loving Anti-Semite\nThe media is very interested in racism.

And for those of us who\u2019ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.\nEven though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican. In fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement\u2014Stay in the fight! Keep the Faith. Never surrender!\nThis address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy. And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century\u2019s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later. May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today. MJM\nThe Archbishop Speaks\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nAs I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt\u2019s introductory talk referenced above.] And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr. Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X. And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.\nAs Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary. It is very difficult to understand the situation today. My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome. Why? These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council. They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians. All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council. Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?\nI think that because in the Second Vatican Council, and after the Council, there is a mutation, a change, in the Church. But we do not change. We continue the Tradition. So why do they now say, as Mgr. (Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, \u201cyou are out of communion with the Church.\u201d I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church? This is possible? I do not understand. Why? I have done nothing. I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.\nMgr. Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome. Mgr. Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, \u201cYou must say this New Mass in all of your houses.\u201d\nI wonder why Mgr. Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.[2] He could have done so. For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries. Well, I refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church. Because now they are destroying the Church. When I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, \u201cYou destroyed the Church.\u201d I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church. I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church. I do not destroy the Church. And so I said to Mgr. Benelli, \u201cNo, I will not sign that writing.\u201d\nI think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council. And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly? When, then? At the beginning of the Council? No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council]. Pope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.\nIn [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari. And what did these Instructions say? The Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church. The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century. The Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons. One day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope. And even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons. Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.\nIn 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan. He wrote in his book, Il Santo, that \u201cWe [modernists]\u2026want a reform in the Church\u2026without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority\u2026even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.\u201d[4] \u201cThe reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.\u201d The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience! And I think\u2026well, here we are! In this time! The reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest. And all they say is \u201cObedience, obedience, obedience.\u201d\nThe Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [\u201cthe banner of revolution\u201d]. They said that. They wrote that! One century before [the Council]! Thus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!\nAs the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council. There were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others. Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.\nThe schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled \u201c\u2026On Religious Tolerance\u201d and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled \u201cOn Religious Freedom [Liberty].\u201d When we read these two schemas, we thought, \u201cThis is impossible. How is it we can receive two opposing theses? One says we must not tolerate error. The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.\u201d And so, we go into the meeting. Cardinal Ottaviani, standing, says to Cardinal Bea, \u201cYou have no authority to compose this schema, because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission.\u201d As Cardinal Bea stands up, he says, \u201cI do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty, and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.\u201d Cardinal Bea, addressing Cardinal Ottaviani, further said, \u201cI am opposed to your schema.\u201d\nImpossible! We were in a very sad, serious situation. Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers. He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong. But before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema. Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani? Who is with Cardinal Bea? The conservatives and the liberals. As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.\nThis historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year. Isn't it time for you to subscribe?\nAnd as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria). And now one month ago in Rome, the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry, the date of his inscription in Masonry, the date [of his rising to] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry, the date [of his rising to] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry, and the places where he [attended] the meetings of Freemasonry. This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council. That is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop. And now this is public. Nobody has been able to refute the publication. And so, we have (I am confident) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council.\nNow, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad. That is not true. Why? Because when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council. In the name of the Council! It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council. And if the reforms are bad, then it is impossible that the Council is good and all the reforms are bad, because that is the authentic interpretation of the Council by Rome. Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform. We can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council. They know that. And I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council. Even if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!\nFor example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom. I have heard this (personally) twice. The first time I was in Columbia.\nWhen I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia. [The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion. They changed it. They removed this article. I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia. The President said he is very, very anxious. He said to the people, \u201ceven though we remove this article we remain Catholic. I am a Catholic, I shall remain Catholic, and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country.\u201d\nThen, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was \u201cprogress,\u201d \u201chumanity,\u201d \u201cevolution,\u201d and all the hubris of a Freemason. And during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference, [the Secretary] said, \u201cin the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [of Vatican II], we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution.\u201d\nI met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia, and he said for two years they [had been asking] the President, in the name of the Holy See, to change this article in their Constitution. But I will never\u2026I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council. Are you sure? Yes, sure. It is evident.\nNow I said to the [Secretary], \u201cAs I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago. The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.\u201d (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic. The Valais is Catholic. And in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais \u2013 Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.) And [the Secretary] said, \u201cYes, I am responsible for this change.\u201d Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ? What is this for you? What do you say when you say \u201cthy kingdom come\u201d in your prayer, the Our Father? \u201cAh,\u201d the Nuncio said to me, \u201cNow it is impossible.\u201d What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas? \u201cAh, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.\u201d\nIt is incredible. And all in the name of the Council.\nWe must take care, because this change in the church is a liberal change. The liberal principles have entered the Church now, and they destroy the Church. If we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world\u2026\n[missing audio...]\nThe truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ. We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, \u201cTu solus Altissimus,\u201d \u201cTu solus Dominus,\u201d \u201cYou alone are the Highest,\u201d \u201cYou alone are the Lord.\u201d But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same. We cannot say that. Impossible. We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion]. We must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth. That is impossible.\nAnd the change in the liturgy is very important. It is very bad. One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, \u201cmodern man,\u201d is democracy. And democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people. The authority comes from God. Not from the people. Not from the masses. From God. But today the principle, the democratic principle, is that the authority is in the people. It is in the masses. That is not true. It is impossible. And our liturgy is the school of our Faith. It is the first school of our Faith for all people.\nI was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years. I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read. They can see what the priest does. They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ. And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest. They know that. That is very important.\nBut the change in the Mass destroys the Church. Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy. The true liturgy is hierarchical. It is not democratic but hierarchical. Why? Because we have God, the priest, and then the people. That is hierarchy. When we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest. That is hierarchy.\nBut now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table. The priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal. That is a new liturgy. That is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life. We need the authority of God. We need the Real Presence of God on our altar. We need the Sacrifice of the Mass \u2013 not a meal only \u2013 but the Sacrifice. So, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar. That is the school of our Faith.\nAnd slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates. It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction]. I do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid. I do not say that. But perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].\nRecently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence. They found that twenty-two percent no longer have the faith, the belief in the Real Presence. But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith. No faith.\nLast year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers. This one priest came from France. His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river. The uncle had nine children. The Bishop said to the new priest, \u201cNow you can say Mass for your uncle. Now you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.\u201d The new priest said, \u201cNo, never.\u201d Why? It is not useful to say Mass for the dead? \u201cNo, no, it is impossible. They are already in heaven.\u201d This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland. They are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything. They learn nothing now.\nAnother example. Recently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris. One of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student. They told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris. I asked them, \u201cWhy do you come to see me?\u201d They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris. There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris. During the meeting, the priest, before he celebrated the Eucharist, said, \u201cToday we celebrate the Eucharist, but we do not believe in the Real Presence.\u201d These two young men said \u201cThat is impossible. We cannot remain in this seminary.\u201d So, they came to meet me. They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith. They asked for admittance to Econe. And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October. But that is a new religion. It is a Protestant religion. That is a fact.\nPerhaps you can say, \u201cHow is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change? How is it possible the pope signed this decree? Signed this constitution?\u201d I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. It is a big mystery. A big mystery. There are many proposed theological answers. I cannot subscribe to all of them. Some say the pope is not responsible. Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible. Perhaps, I don\u2019t know. Some say there are two popes [(a body double)]. I don\u2019t know. Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave). We do not know. We do know now that Bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy, and that he is an infamous Freemason. And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.\nI don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. Now, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry. No, you cannot say that. It is possible, but we do not know. But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope. Not pope. Illegitimate. I don\u2019t know. It is a mystery I cannot understand. But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that. This pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church. He said, \u201cThe smoke of Satan has entered the Church.\u201d But where are the men responsible for the destruction of the Church? Well, there they are. They are the men who destroy the Church. We must show where they are. Where is this smoke of Satan that has entered the Church? I do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.\nAnd I have these experiences every day. I visit many countries. I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days. Then I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference. Many people came. Many people are confused. What is happening in the Church? They are anxious. But many people say that we disobey. Disobey? Obedience is relative. It is not absolute. It is relative to the good, but not to the evil. We cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing. We cannot obey. It is clear.\nAnd I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad. The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist. And so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives. They are modernists. Whereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative. So, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.\nAnd we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist. That is a fact. That is impossible. How can they do that? I do not know. I do not know. I have not spent my whole life in Rome. I do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State. And I know that very well. But I think that the devil is in Rome, as was said by our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of La Salette.\nWe must pray. We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church. Because if this crisis continues, many people will go to hell. They lose the faith. They cannot go into the church. They abandon the faith. You know that many priests have abandoned the faith. Many priests have gotten married. And many sisters have abandoned their congregations. It is a pity. And it is everywhere.\nI was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress. Cardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship. I read in the newspaper about a Mass Cardinal Knox celebrated during the Eucharistic Congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the Consecration were pronounced. That is a sacrilege. You cannot go to that Mass. That is sacrilege. This is a fact. They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress. They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi. Ay. Impossible. Impossible. No, no, no, no. [applause]\nThis change is not accidental. It is not superficial. It is very deep. Very bad. It is against our faith. Against our faith. And so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome. From Rome we expect only the good. We do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass. We need this adoration. We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Because all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass. It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.\nHe is King because he is God. He is the Son of God. So, He is King by His nature. This is essential. Essential! And if He is God, we must give Him the adoration of God. And so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth. Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Jesus Christ is God. That is a fundamental truth of our Faith. And it all depends on this Truth. And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation]. They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly. They are afraid of the truth. That is very bad.\nAnd it is the same in Rome. I think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth]. When I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr. Benelli told me he visits the pope every day. He said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting. Immediately, he said, he would be going. So, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope? Because they are afraid.\nMeanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned. Here, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:\nCardinal Villot said, \u201cWe are afraid if Msgr. Lefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind.\u201d Because [the pope] is not too sure; the pope is not man of true conviction. He is a mysterious man. We cannot give a definition of the man. He expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite. Some part of him will speak the truth. Another part of him is open to error. Very curious. And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] \u201cyou must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day. You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,\u201d then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.\nAnd so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope. It is impossible to admit me. And I know the pope very well! When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year. And during those eleven years, I met Msgr. Montini. I know him very well. He received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope. But, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: \u201cNo, impossible! You must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.\u201d But I cannot do that. For me, if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church. The Church!\nSo, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations. For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland \u2013 applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain. Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere. And why? Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome? They know that. But still they come. I ask them, why do you come to Econe? You know our situation. They say, \u201cYes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests. We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass. And so, we are Coming to Econe.\u201d\nAnd as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here. We have very good young men. I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe. In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest. But these young men refuse to become protestants. They refuse to become modernist. They ask to become true priests. And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.\nSo, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties. I think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries. And we have confidence in God. Since I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us. Because it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself. We now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York. In Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters). And I am building a seminary in Switzerland. It is impossible to do all this without God\u2019s assistance.\nSo, I have confidence. It is impossible for the Church to change its tradition. The tradition of twenty centuries. That we cannot change. The Church is tradition. The Church is tradition. It is not revolution. I thank you for your attention.\nNOTES:\n[1] Archbishop Benelli, who had the title of \u201cSubstitute\u201d (meaning the Assistant to the Secretary of State) of the Vatican Secretariat of State, later created Cardinal and appointed Archbishop of Florence in 1977.\n[2] Until the date of this meeting, March 19, 1976, nothing had been said to Archbishop Lefebvre about this condition of submission, which submission was demanded of him as a condition to his request for a Papal Audience.

At an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious.\nSupporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote. In the past they had been ratified as a bloc.\nThe first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved, but when they got to Lew, the only Jewish director, he was rejected 105 to 73. In a subsequent Facebook post, Lew wrote, \u201cMy Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.\u201d\nAn outcry followed, leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau, to investigate. She also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.\nBoudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation. His findings, he wrote, do \u201cnot substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,\u201d which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews.\nRather, he found, votes against Lew were \u201cmotivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement.\u201d Protests about Israel\u2019s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew\u2019s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was \u201chonest and even understandable.\u201d\nA statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU. Boudreau\u2019s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October.\nDemocratize SSMU deleted the message, which targeted Lew and two other candidates, after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was \u201cinsensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.\u201d\nThe Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric \u201cwas used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew. It is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.\u201d\nThey say Boudreau\u2019s report \u201cinsinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.\u201d\nLew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution. He was not immediately available for comment.\nMichael Mostyn, CEO of B\u2019nai Brith Canada, called the report a whitewash. \u201cThe report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,\u201d he said in a statement.\nFortier said the university\u2019s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April.\n\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u2022 Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Virginia man who wanted to join ISIS pleads guilty to lying about overseas trip\nNORFOLK, Va. \u2014 While texting with an FBI informant in September 2016, a Williamsburg man expressed admiration for a U.S. Army officer who shot and killed 13 soldiers on Fort Hood, Texas, according to court documents.\nLater that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force. And in the application process, he lied to military recruiters about a recent trip he'd taken to Jordan in a failed attempt to make contact with the Islamic State and join a \"real Muslim Army,\" the documents said.\nPatel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements. He faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4.\nAccording to court documents and prosecutors, Patel \u2013 who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago \u2013 traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English. While there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims.\nHis employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said.\nJordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later. It's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State.\nA search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China.\nJordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation. On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit.\nThere, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State. He explained he went to Jordan in part to find like-minded Muslims, and because he wanted to do something \u201cbigger, better, and more purposeful\u201d \u2013 like dying in the cause of Allah.\nBut, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad.\nIn the course of their conversations, Patel discussed his desire to see a holy war between Muslims and non-Muslims. He also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group\u2019s flag. He said he wanted to replace his neighbor\u2019s American flag with it.\nPatel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016. Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations \u2013 like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices.\nWhile back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source. He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood. In the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky. He also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.\nCourt documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.\nSimply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law. Patel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017. Court documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.\nBefore Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.\nDuring the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims. Patel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one.\nAfter Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.\n\u00a92018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)\nVisit The Virginian-Pilot at pilotonline.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n", ["Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. -Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution\nRight off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason. However, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton\u2019s charities during the Obama administration.\nThe Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday:\nThe informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton. ... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials \u201ctold me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative.\" \u201cThe contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months. APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.\" APCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm. They added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.\nIn case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010. The sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason.\nWhile Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, \u201c[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton\u2019s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval. They were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.\u201d\nIn a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:\nOn Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration\u2019s failure to stop Russia\u2019s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets. Campbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government. According to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation\u2019s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran. In an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program. At the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One. \u201cTENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,\u201d stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI. TVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow. \u201cThey (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor. Fabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.\u201d Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group. He stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of \u201cTVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned. I do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.\u201d In the briefs, he informed the FBI that \u201coccasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.\u201d And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they \u201coccasionally speak of the relationship, i.e. equipment, consulting. I asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion. His response was a smile and shoulder shrug.\u201d But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians. Those transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom. He had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said. Senior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell\u2019s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia\u2019s acquisition of the Canadian company. In fact, Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama\u2019s classified presidential daily briefings.\nOf course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings. They are somewhere in the White House sewer system.\nCampbell's work has resulted in real justice being administered. In January, I reported:\nOn Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal. Sadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland. Lambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. According to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at \u201cTransportation Corporation A\u201d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX. In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like \u201clucky figures,\u201d \u201cLF,\u201d \u201clucky numbers,\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account. The indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A\u2019s services. In June 2015, Lambert\u2019s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.\nWe also know the following about Campbell:\nUndercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an \"iron clad\" gag order was lifted in October\nCampbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI\nwhile Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \"nuclear money laundering apparatus \"\n\" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation\nCampbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\nof bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.

There is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.\nAre we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?

They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity\u201d (CCC 2357).\nHowever, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need \u201ccloser pastoral care\u201d and \u201cone must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement. I do not really see any problems there.\u201d\nMarx is the President of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference.\nAs LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said \u201cyes,\u201d he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.\nThis \u201cencouragement\u201d from priests which he called for might include some sort of \u201cliturgical\u201d recognition of their union.\nBut \u201chow this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,\u201d is \u201canother question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.\u201d\nAfter Catholic News Agency\u2019s initial report on Marx\u2019s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.\nThe cardinal\u2019s office sent CNA \u201ca request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.\u201d\nThe cardinal\u2019s office maintains that rather than saying \u201cyes,\u201d there is a possibility of liturgical \u201cblessing\u201d of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit \u201cyes.\u201d However, the German Bishops\u2019 Conference doesn\u2019t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how \u201cone must encourage priests\u201d to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a \u201cliturgical\u201d form.\nThe cardinal\u2019s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically \u201cblessing\u201d gay unions to: \u201cThere are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.\u201d\nPhiladelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx\u2019s proposal.\n\u201cAny such \u2018blessing rite\u2019 would cooperate in a morally forbidden act, no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing,\u201d wrote Chaput. He explained such a \u201cblessing\u201d would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable.\n\u201cThere is no love \u2013 no charity \u2013 without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCreating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.\u201d\n\u201cThere are two principles we need to remember,\u201d Chaput wrote. \u201cFirst, we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity. This emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction. Second, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.\u201d\n\u201cThis in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,\u201d he explained. \u201cJesus said the truth will make us free. Nowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.\u201d\nCordes has a history of defending the Church\u2019s moral teaching.\nMarx, one of the pope\u2019s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have \u201cworth\u201d which must be recognized by the Church.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion"]], ["NASA captures farthest ever image from Earth\n\u00a9 Press Release The historic photograph taken by the New Horizons spacecraft.

And, just for good measure he accused the people accusing him \u2013 victims of sexual abuse by Barros\u2019 mentor, the convicted sex-predator Karadima \u2013 of committing \u201ccalumny\u201d? [1] And remember when Cardinal O\u2019Malley told the pope off in public over the \u201cpain\u201d these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse? And then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there\u2019s still \u201cno evidence\u201d against Barros\u2026?\nThe press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros\u2019 complicity in Karadima\u2019s sexual abuse \u2013 not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant. Nicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse:\nPope Francis received a victim\u2019s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter\u2019s author and members of Francis\u2019 own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.\nThe fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for sex abuse and cover-ups. It also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy.\nNow it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop. The Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, \u201chad already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.\u201d\n\u201cBut with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to\u2026Osorno.\u201d\nThe article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros. The accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.\nWhile the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse. The website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller. When, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, \u201cI am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions. I have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.\u201d\nMarco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments. Without naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:\n\u201cIt was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy. The nuncio has prepared the triad [the \u201cterna\u201d or list of three candidates]. A cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: \u2018The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good. But I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality. He responds little to the necessary criteria. But the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.\u2019 The meeting ended without further decisions.\u201d\nWhatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference. Bergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that. Even while \u201capologising\u201d the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, \u201cYou, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven\u2019t seen any, because they haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\u201cIn the case of Barros it\u2019s been observed, it\u2019s been studied; there\u2019s no evidence. The best thing to do if someone believes it\u2019s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.\u201d\nThe AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O\u2019Malley, the pope\u2019s \u201ctop abuse advisor,\u201d with the letter to deliver to the pope.\nMarie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican\u2019s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, \u201cWhen we gave him [O\u2019Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns. And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\u201d Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, \u201cCardinal O\u2019Malley called me after the pope\u2019s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me, among other things, that he had given the letter to the pope \u2013 in his hands.\u201d\nOn the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here. In fact, unless Cardinal O\u2019Malley \u2013 who has, as of this writing, remained silent \u2013 comes forward and says that he didn\u2019t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied. And this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.\nAs Winfield writes,\n\u201cThe revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5]. More recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year. Vatican analysts now openly question whether he \u2018gets it,\u2019 and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo evidence\u2026\u201d Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.\nOne of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that \u201cno evidence\u201d is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio. He said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering. The hoopla surrounding the \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment tends to obscure the context of the comment.\nIt was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca \u2013 a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013. Ilze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, \u201cWhat you intend to do about this? How are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?\u201d\nWhat reply did Bergoglio give? His standard one: \u201cNo evidence.\u201d\nAbout Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation. And from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged. We did not find anything of that. This is the response.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\nBut Ricca\u2019s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious. They include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army. So flagrant was Ricca\u2019s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay\u2019s nuncio to have him removed. It was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L\u2019Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by \u201cnumerous bishops, priests, religious and laity\u201d in Uruguay[6].\nIn fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio\u2019s normal procedures. As \u201cMarcantonio Colonna\u201d wrote in the Dictator Pope, \u201cIn fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.\u201d\nIt was at this early \u201cno evidence\u201d comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio\u2019s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly. And in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you\u2019re caught.\nThe pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio\u2019s policy since long before he came on the international scene. He has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off. Perhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole. Indeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.\n\u201cArgentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis\u2026\u201d\nThough the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public. On their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn\u2019t interested in hearing from victims.\n\u201cIn Pope Francis\u2019s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops\u2019 conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\u201cAll of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,\u201d the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem. The site says that \u201cin addition to Bergoglio\u2019s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.\u201d\nIn fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese. Weeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, \u201cIn my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.\u201d Francis added that he agreed with the \u201czero tolerance\u201d attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict\u2019s reforms \u2013 most of which he was later to quietly reverse.\nIt was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope\u2019s attention. One, known to the press only as \u201cGabriel,\u201d wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio C\u00e9sar Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, \u201cwho has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Mor\u00f3n and the Court of Cassation. So far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.\u201d\nIn case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope\u2019s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, \u201cA year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi\u2019s trial, three men ransacked the survivor\u2019s apartment and beat him.\u201d These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.\nTen years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, \u201cGabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires. An employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.\u201d\nThe group surmises that it was Bergoglio\u2019s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals. In 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a \u201cmedia campaign\u201d and claimed that the Grassi case was \u201cdifferent\u201d from other accusations. During his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio \u201cnever let go\u201d of his hand. In 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of \u201cGabriel,\u201d who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.\nSeveral more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.\nA virtuoso performance-liar\nLooking back and carefully examining his record, Jorge Bergoglio\u2019s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident. It is arguable that even the members of the so-called \u201cSan Gallen Mafia\u201d who apparently conspired to put him on Peter\u2019s throne were used by him. But he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.\nLooking carefully at the infamous \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment, this was clear early on. The first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie, and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general. Recall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election. At the time, the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine.\nBut perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed. (Don\u2019t forget, no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time. Journalists must submit their questions well in advance.) This was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality, a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby\u2019s US trade magazine.\nRead his full answer carefully:\nI see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for \u201csins from youth\u201d, for example, and then publish them. They are not crimes, right? Crimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime. No, sins.\nBut if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives. When we confess our sins and we truly say, \u201cI have sinned in this\u201d, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins. That is a danger.\nThis is important: a theology of sin. Many times I think of Saint Peter. He committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope. We have to think a great deal about that.\nBut, returning to your question more concretely. In this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn\u2019t find anything. This is the first question. Then, you spoke about the gay lobby. So much is written about the gay lobby. I still haven\u2019t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with \u201cgay\u201d on it. They say there are some there.\nI believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good. This one is not good.\nIf someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him? The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: \u201cno one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society\u201d. The problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one. The problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies. For me, this is the greater problem. Thank you so much for asking this question. Many thanks.\nOne of the pope\u2019s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy. He starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue. This was the first time a pope had ever used the political term \u201cgay\u201d. Not \u201chomosexual,\u201d not \u201csame-sex attracted,\u201d but \u201cgay,\u201d meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement\u2019s linguistic manipulations. Language counts in politics, and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion \u2013 and his pontificate \u2013 by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching, and in direct opposition to his immediate, and still living, predecessor.\nIn this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to \u201cdisagree\u201d with Catholic teaching on sexuality. There are very few \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool. This means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience, a sly message to say, \u201cPeople talk all the time about a gay lobby, but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense, propaganda from those people\u2026 those conservatives\u2026We cool and hip people don\u2019t hate gays, do we?\u201d\nThis astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up. We are simply asked to take the pope\u2019s word for it, but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca\u2019s homosexual activity in the first place, we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth.\nNext, after another little inside nudge-nudge-wink-wink joke about the \u201cgay lobby\u201d \u2013 implying (but of course never outright saying) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense \u2013 we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor, Pope Benedict Ratzinger. \u201cThe problem is not having this tendency.\u201d Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests. The \u201ctendency\u201d is called in the same catechism you quote \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d and Ratzinger was very clear that this \u201ctendency\u201d is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that \u201cmust\u201d preclude a man from being ordained.\nSquandering the capital of trust\nA few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:\nA mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality. But Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics. Lying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.\nThomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes. Habitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth. This of course means that a person whose \u201corientation,\u201d as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies. He tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality. It was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare\u2019s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.\nHuman beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie. This is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don\u2019t see it coming. The first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time. We therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.\nConsidering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965, how much un-earned trust Francis started with just by being elected, this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history. Believing Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching. Sandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times, in only the last few months, that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention, the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church.\nOf course this would be of little interest to secular journalists, who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting Catholicism, but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in, a fact Bergoglio seems not to have understood. It is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar \u2013 that in fact truth, like reality, seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool.\nSociologists talk about the concept of the \u201chigh trust society,\u201d one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately. They warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos, in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families. This is the way societies disintegrate. It has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.\nWith a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne, blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine, how long before that predictable disintegration occurs? Are we seeing it already? Are we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics? With Cardinal Marx and others promoting \u201cblessings\u201d for \u201csame-sex unions\u201d are we going to be seeing an escalation of it? I have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised, their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete.\nI am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio\u2019s support has completely dried up. He has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe-to-toe with him in a shouting match, it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission.\nMarie Collins, by no stretch even a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has \u201cdefinitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope\u201d in Francis.\n\u201cAll I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now\u2026and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,\u201d she told the National Catholic Reporter.\nIt may seem like a moment to enjoy, seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking, but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run. There is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust. Already fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis, how much will there be to repair of the once-steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this?\nNotes:\n[1] \u201cNot one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof. This is slander and calumny. Is that clear?\u201d\n[2] The book \u201cThe Dictator Pope\u201d relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State. It is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.\n[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world\u2026 and drives the rest of us spare. Italians care about getting a general picture of what\u2019s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.\n[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission\u2019s recommendations. The time limit of the Commission\u2019s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.\n[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest \u2013 now laicised \u2013 approached some of the pope\u2019s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.\n[6] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard. Sandro Magister reported after the \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment, \u201cBefore the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly. He had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.\u201d\n", ["Repetition", "Conversation_Killer", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["The Sun is getting cooler and dimmer, but scientists aren\u2019t worried\nIn what is being considered a particularly rare event, scientists are projecting that the Sun will be an unusually cool customer by the year 2050. By combining data and observations from decades of Sun research, experts are predicting a \u201cGrand Solar Minimum\u201d will occur a few decades from now, making our parent star dimmer and cooler than it has been for a very long time.\nThe Sun might look the same to you today as it has since the first time you laid eyes on it, but our star actually displays plenty of changes. The Sun goes through regular cycles of solar minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum). These patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there\u2019s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way.\nThe study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego. After combing the data, Lubin\u2019s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star.\nDuring a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth. This can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground. Those changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult. The grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects.\nThe most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s. The event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over. However, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs. This temporary shakeup of temperatures could happen again, though the researchers say it will have very little effect on the overall global warming trend that mankind has created for itself.\n", ["Appeal_to_Authority", "Conversation_Killer"]], ["Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government\nThe McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he\u2019s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week.\nNoah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students\u2019 Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.

Westerville Police Chief Joe Morbitzer said officer Eric Joering, 39, died at the scene and his colleague, Anthony Morelli, 54, died at a local hospital.

Recently, a video clip of anti-Semitic pastor Steve Anderson \u2013 making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed \u2013 wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout. According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Anderson\u2019s declaration \u201cmakes a lot of sense.\u201d With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him?\nSofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida.\nOn January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona. Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS. In the clip, Anderson states the following: \u201cAnd the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right? For 1800 sum odd years. And by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly. Why? \u2018Cause God\u2019s blessing them? No. \u2018Cause they\u2019re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nBlaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long, which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others, is incredibly offensive. Indeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson\u2019s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews.\nTowards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people\u2019s faces. He zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, \u201cYou say, \u2018Why are you preaching against the Jews?\u2019 Well, don\u2019t come back next Wednesday night. Because, next Wednesday night, God\u2019s wrath is on the Jews even more!\u201d\nAbout the clip, on Facebook, Zakkout wrote above it, \u201cMakes a lot of sense!\u201d Of course, this is coming from someone [Zakkout] who regularly refers to Jews as \u201cmonkeys and pigs,\u201d and in February 2016, circulated on social media a report claiming that \u201cthe Holocaust was faked.\u201d The report calls the Holocaust \u201cthe biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity\u201d and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as \u201cthe greatest leader in modern Western history.\u201d\nBoth Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism. In July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website. The ADL described the video as \u201cvenomous.\u201d In October 2015, Zakkout praised Duke, as \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d\nBesides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan. During the clip, Farrakhan repeatedly labels the Jewish people \u201cSatan.\u201d He states, \u201cReally, they\u2019re not Jews. No, that\u2019s Satan. You should learn to call them by their real name, \u2018Satan.\u2019 You\u2019re coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.\u201d\nZakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself. In July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami. Rally goers repeatedly shouted, \u201cWe are Hamas\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go Hamas.\u201d After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: \u201cThank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!\u201d He signed it \u201cBr. Sofian Zakkout.\u201d The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, \"Hamas is in my heart and on my head.\"\nAll of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County. Serving alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials. One would think that they would find Zakkout\u2019s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged.\nIf the board members of Crime Stoppers and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch do not wish to be associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan, then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout.\nThe time is long overdue that these groups maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public. Sofian Zakkout\u2019s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security. His presence on the boards of both organizations constitutes an obscene travesty. Once and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands for.\nBeila Rabinowitz, Director of Militant Islam Monitor, contributed to this report.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["'Oumuamua: Space Cigar Is Still Spinning From Mysterious Violent Collision\nThe solar system\u2019s strange cigar-shaped visitor 'Oumuamua\u2014Hawaiian for \u201cscout\u201d or \u201cmessenger\u201d\u2014is tumbling chaotically as the result of a violent collision.

But unfortunately we can\u2019t get a high-resolution image of this thing to see what kind of crater is on it that might be attributed to the collision that caused it to start tumbling.\"\nThe team think 'Oumuamua may eventually move less chaotically.\n\"The tumbling actually causes stresses and strains internal to the object, and that slowly but surely squeezes and pulls on the object just like tides on the Earth to remove energy from the spin,\" Fraser said.\nBut, at least for the next few billion years, the space invader is destined to continue its topsy-turvy spin.\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["NASA releases images captured at a record-breaking 3.79 billion miles from Earth\nNASA has a whole lot of fancy image-gathering hardware on Earth and in space, and we\u2019ve seen countless of stunning snapshots taken from here on Earth as well as nearby planets like Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

It is mercy for the predator priests,\u201d she told EWTN\u2019s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over.\n\u201cThere are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,\u201d she added. (See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below)\nYore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse. The Pope\u2019s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.\n\u201cThe Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,\u201d Yore said during the interview.\nYore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was \u201ctold from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment. He received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,\u201d she said.\nAs details continue to surface, the pontiff\u2019s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well.\nYore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros \u201ca scandal of epic proportions.\u201d\nThe scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.\nYore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church \u2014 you know, the last appeal \u2014 that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] \u2018Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?\u2019\u201d\nReports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse. The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.\nPope Francis received the victim\u2019s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis\u2019s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.\nFrancis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest \u201ccalumny.\u201d\nWhile Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are \u201cslander.\u201d\nThe Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna \u2013 the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.\nExpectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission. And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don\u2019t match his tough stances on abuse.\nFour members of the commission had met with Cardinal O\u2019Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.\nIt was at the meeting with O\u2019Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O\u2019Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.\nYore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored. Further, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified \u2014 including the letter\u2019s author Juan Carlos \u2014 to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.\nArroyo spoke with Cruz as well, who said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d when Barros was going to be appointed. He\u2019d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse, he said, but Barros had special significance for him because Barros\u2019 part went beyond witnessing the abuse, to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation.\nCruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard. And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O\u2019Malley.\nCruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope\u2019s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.\n\u201cTo hear him talk about us that way,\u201d Cruz said, \u201ccalling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.\u201d\nScicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.\n\u201cThis leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,\u201d Yore said. \u201cHere we have victims 10, 15 years after their abuse, begging the Pope, having to take pictures of a letter that\u2019s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the Pope is receiving this information.\u201d\nThe whole of Latin America, including Argentina, was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in Chile in 2010, Yore noted, and yet the Pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information.

In the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No! And your addition \u201cin individual cases\u201d is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force. A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.\nCardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing. Why not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?\nNow, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects. The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:\nFor Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service \u2013 whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day. The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more. Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments. But parents can bless their children. The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them. [...]\nWhat kind of hope is connected with a blessing? With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection \u2013 sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers. With the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought. [\u2026]\nTo bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it. The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense. [\u2026]\nBut now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin. That is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense. Therefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.\nIf one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women. Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them. This blessing \u2013 which is not related to their acts \u2013 is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!\nThis position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented \u2013 since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] \u2013 by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA); by the German-speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus B\u00fcning. I am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know. Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No! And your addition \u201cin individual cases\u201d is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force. What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an \u201cindividual case\u201d!\nThe idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: \u201cWoe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.\u201d [Isaiah 5:20]\nIs this not exactly what Cardinal Marx \u2013 and others who are thinking like him \u2013 are doing? If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag \u201choney,\u201d the cucumbers still remain sour! Even blessing bishops cannot change that. Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it. He says that he \u201callows himself\u201d to talk like that \u2013 but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish.\nThat seems to catch on these days. For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded! To contradict two popes \u2013 whom the Church has already \u201cbeatified\u201d the one and \u201ccanonized\u201d the other \u2013 so shortly after their deaths, and in such a radical and open manner, probably has never happened before in the Church's history. Isaiah says that such people draw unto them God's punishment, with thick cords!\nNevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well. Whether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Appeal_to_Popularity", "Conversation_Killer", "Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Cardinal M\u00fcller: Blessing homosexual couples would be an \u2018atrocity\u2019\nNewsCatholic Church\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples. The remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode.\nCardinal M\u00fcller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference.\nIn remarks after his address, reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost, the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions, even if only in individual cases: \u201cIf a priest blesses a homosexual couple, then this is an atrocity at a holy site, namely, to approve of something that God does not approve of.\u201d\nAccording to the Tagespost report, Cardinal M\u00fcller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a \u201ctheocentric humanism.\u201d He said the \u201csubmissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions\u201d is a \u201csuicidal modernization\u201d that denies mankind the Truth of God. In this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God. Morality, M\u00fcller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about \u201crules and exceptions\u201d ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.\nIn the discussion following his talk, Cardinal M\u00fcller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia. The cardinal said that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences. \u201cIn dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,\u201d he added. There is only one Magisterium, he said, and bishops' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions. Contradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.\nThus, explained the cardinal, the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them. The controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood \u201cin an orthodox way,\u201d namely that \u201che who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion.\u201d It is, in M\u00fcller's eyes, the pope's duty \u201cto unite the Church, that is what the pope is there for.\u201d This is what he, M\u00fcller, himself told the pope: when the bishops' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia, the Church enters \u201cinto a situation like the one before the Reformation.\u201d\nArchbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths. Promulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi.\nProfessor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference. He stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be \u201cread in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.\u201d In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a \u201ccontinuity with the Magisterium of the Church.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.

The Milky Way measures about 100,000 light-years or 30 kiloparsecs across. This may seem large, but it is rather small when compared to other galaxies.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy has an approximate diameter of 220,000 light years, which is more than double of that of the Milky Way. It is the largest galaxy in the Local Cluster. If it were bright enough, the Andromeda Galaxy would appear larger than the Moon in the sky (as depicted above), even with it being much farther away.

A solar storm, which occurred Monday, is expected to strike Earth tonight.\nOn Monday, the sun spit out a slew of charged particles in a moderate solar flare. These particles are now making their way towards Earth. The planet\u2019s magnetic field will block most of the particles, but some will make it into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The particles collect at the north and south poles and interact with atmospheric gases to create the aurora borealis or the Northern Lights. And some say this show could be quite spectacular.\nSolar flares have been known to cause power grid failures, but it looks like we\u2019ll only get the light show this time. Although a grid failure is possible, it is unlikely.\nAccording to Seeker, the forecast calls for a high probability of a G-1 or \u201cminor\u201d storm, which could strengthen to a G-2 or \u201cmoderate\u201d storm depending on how the stream of particles hit the Earth. Geomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale, with G at the bottom, R in the middle, and S as the most severe. Forecasts now say the particles will give our planet a glancing blow.\nAlthough this storm has been categorized as \u201cG-1,\u201d which means it is minor, it could still cause some havoc down on Earth. Solar flares and particle ejections are associated with sunspots \u2014 dark areas on the sun\u2019s surface \u2014 that host intense magnetic activity. As the magnetic fields in a sunspot cross, NASA stated, this can cause a sudden energy explosion, also known as a solar flare.

People in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.\nPaul St\u00fctz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples \u201coffers an occasion to express love.\u201d\n\u201cThe blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.\u201d At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor.\nSt\u00fctz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant, \u201ca pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family\u201d at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz. Harant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples, and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia.\nAs St\u00fctz reports:\nWe give out that universally available blessing. There, we have nothing to forbid,\u201d says Harant. He sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that \u201ceach person, independent of his sexual orientation, is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect.\nAs the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250.\nIrmgard Lehner, the pastoral assistant of the Wels-St. Franziskus Church, the other of the two parishes that welcome homosexual couples, appreciates this blessing ritual for Valentine's Day, saying it has \u201can enormous power.\u201d During the ceremony, couples come forward in church and receive a hand on their foreheads and a sign of the cross.\n\u201cWe thus stress the high value of relationships,\u201d explains Lehner.\nAs the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: \u201cThis offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations \u2013 also by lesbians and homosexuals.\u201d Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing. \u201cHere with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.\u201d The pastoral assistant adds that \u201cGod is love. There are no restrictions.\u201d\nThe Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish. The group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to \u201creceive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.\u201d\nThe KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:\nIt would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed.\nMoreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group \u2013 also called \u201cRainbow Pastoral.\u201d As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called \u201cQueer Church Services\u201d (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish. It is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.\nSimilar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level.\nAs LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals. Publicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg B\u00e4tzing.\nAdditionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples. Father Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years. He also conducts church services for homosexuals.\nKath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests. As an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference.\nThis moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics. Mathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter.\nAs he sees it, \u201cthe bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,\u201d where they will have to show their colors. They will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or \u201cessentially accept them,\u201d at least by \u201csaying nothing.\u201d\nHe concludes:\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Cardinal O\u2019Malley will head revived Vatican abuse panel\nCardinal Sean O\u2019Malley has been reappointed as the head of a Vatican commission on child sex abuse, as Pope Francis on Saturday revived the panel in the wake of widespread condemnation last month of the pontiff\u2019s defense of a Chilean bishop accused of witnessing and ignoring abuse.\nThe Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors lapsed in December, when its members\u2019 terms expired, prompting concerns that the advisory body could be disbanded.\nIn addition to O\u2019Malley\u2019s return as the panel\u2019s president, Pope Francis named seven returning members and nine new members representing countries around the world, including Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, and India, according to a statement from the Vatican.\nAdvertisement\nSome members are themselves survivors of abuse, according to the statement, but they were not identified to protect their privacy.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

With mass immigration, especially from Africa, \"our worst nightmares can come true. The West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.\"\nOrban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis.\nTo achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West. Eastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead.\nBut migration dominates his agenda now.\nOrban said on Sunday that Europe faces a critical fissure between nation states of the East and the West, which he called an \"immigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours\".\nAs the West wants eastern Europe to follow its lead, an increasingly vicious struggle was likely, he said, alluding to a plan to redraw the European alliance advocated by the leaders of France and Germany.\n\"Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,\" Orban said to loud applause. \"Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools. The first is our 'Stop Soros' law.\"\nOrban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism.\nThe Hungarian leader has advocated \"ethnic homogeneity\" and compared Soros, a Jew, to a puppet master unleashing immigration onto Europe to undermine its cultural and economic integrity.\nA defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe.\nOrban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants.\nVoters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls.\nPOWERFUL ALLIES\nOrban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.\nSoros, for his part, compared Orban unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's -- when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany -- and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation.\nOrban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university.\nAttributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration.\n\"Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,\" he said. \"Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted. It won't work. We are not alone and we will fight together ... and we will succeed.\"\nIn Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU. He said a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen the nationalist fold.\n\"We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,\" Orban said. \"The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.\" (Reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Catherine Evans)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Hungarian Prime Minister: \u2018Christianity is Europe\u2019s last hope\u2019\nNewsFaith, Politics - World\nBUDAPEST, Hungary, February 19, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 Brushing aside any semblance of political correctness, Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister said in his state of the nation speech on Sunday that, \u201cChristianity is Europe's last hope.\u201d\nAddressing his country and the world, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n warned that European nations which have encouraged migration have, \u201copened the way to the decline of Christian culture and the advance of Islam.\u201d\nOrb\u00e1n painted an image of Western Europe being overwhelmed by the accelerating influx Muslim immigrants in recent years.\n\u201cAccording to estimates, the proportion of immigrants will grow at an accelerated pace in the European countries west of us,\u201d said Orb\u00e1n. \u201cI won't even say anything about France and Holland, but even the born Germans are being forced back from most large German cities as migrants always occupy big cities first.\u201d\nOrb\u00e1n warned that as Western Europe becomes saturated with Muslim occupants, Islamists would soon seek to stream in to his country from both Western Europe as well as from Islamic nations.\n\u201cThis means that the Islamic civilization, which always considers its vocation to convert Europe to what it calls the true faith, in the future will be knocking on the door of Central Europe not only from the south, but from the west, as well,\u201d he said.\nPrime Minister Orb\u00e1n said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to \u201cincrease migration\u201d around the world.\nIn June, LifeSiteNews reported that Orb\u00e1n had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation\u2019s politics.\nBillionaire George Soros, who famously backs many progressive initiatives around the world, locked horns with Orb\u00e1n over the Central European University (CEU) he founded in 1989, which has been criticized as a funnel for anti-nationalist views.\nOrb\u00e1n and Soros have a history, beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony.\nOrb\u00e1n started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship.

The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests.\nHere\u2019s a look what drove the panel\u2019s creation and what to expect in the future.\nWhat is Pope Francis\u2019 commission on sexual abuse?\nFollowing criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it.\nO\u2019Malley was not only a member of the pope\u2019s \u201cG9\u201d group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie \u201cSpotlight.\u201d\nThe revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them.\nWhen he created the commission, Francis said: \u201cThe commission\u2019s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.\u201d\nWhy is it being renewed now?\nAfter the commission\u2019s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy. O\u2019Malley returns as chief.\nNew members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, \"reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,\u201d the Vatican said.\nWhat did the first commission achieve?\nThe Vatican has said it \u201cworked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.\u201d\nWhat didn\u2019t it do?\nCommission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.\nEven if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests\u2019 behavior, those strictures were not enough, O\u2019Malley said in 2014. \u201cThere are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,\u201d he said.\nThe commission was behind Francis\u2019 decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years. But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground. In 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem.\nFrancis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault.\nAny other problems?\nCommission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to \u201cpark\u201d the priest out of harm\u2019s way. But this simple message was hard to get across.\nIt emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so.\nDid commission members persevere?\nNot all of them. British member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016. He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise.\nIrish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission\u2019s request \u2014 approved by the pope \u2014 to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims.\nMarie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile. Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press\nWas the pope listening to the commission?\nPossibly not. In 2015, Collins handed O\u2019Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010.\nCruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile.\nThe pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as \u201clefties\u201d and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month. \"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,\" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz. That was too much for O\u2019Malley, who said Francis had caused \"great pain\u201d to victims.\nIf Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to?\nVatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.\nSo is the pope intransigent on Barros?\nNo. Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country. On Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia.\n\"For the first time I felt that someone is listening,\" Cruz said after the meeting.\nWhat happens next?\n\u201cThis should lead to Barros stepping down,\u201d said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse.

Depending on an alien\u2019s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.\nFollowing are criminal summaries of three offenders arrested during this operation:\nFeb. 14 \u2013 A previously deported 42-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in Harlingen, Texas. He was convicted in 2011 of indecency with a child, a felony, and was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 probation. He is currently facing federal criminal charges for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported. He remains in U.S. Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case.\nFeb. 15 \u2013 A 42- year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio. He was convicted in 2008 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to four months in federal prison. In October 2017, he was convicted for DUI and sentenced to 15 months in prison. He is currently in ICE custody pending removal.\nFeb. 13 \u2013 A previously deported 40-year-old illegal alien from Mexico was arrested in San Antonio. He was previously removed to Mexico in 2009 after he illegally entered the United States through Laredo, Texas. Sometime after 2009, he illegally re-entered the United States and was arrested at his residence where officers discovered six handguns in his possession. He is being prosecuted for re-entry after deportation, and illegal alien possessing a firearm. He remains in U.S. Marshals custody pending the outcome of his criminal case.\n\u201cThe results of this operation are a clear indication of ICE\u2019s commitment regarding the role we play in keeping our communities safe by locating, arresting and ultimately removing at-large criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety, and other immigration fugitives,\u201d said Daniel Bible, field office director for ERO in San Antonio. \u201cICE\u2019s leadership has made clear that ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and \u2013 if found removable by final order \u2013 removal from the United States. By effecting these immigration enforcement operations, the dedicated men and women of ICE help keep our communities safe.\u201d\nAll of the targets in this operation were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.\nICE deportation officers carry out targeted enforcement operations daily nationwide as part of the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to protect the nation, uphold public safety, and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls.\nDuring targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter other aliens illegally present in the United States. These aliens are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and, when appropriate, they are arrested by ICE officers.\n", ["Flag_Waving", "Repetition"]], ["DOJ May Hit #Resistance Mayor Who Warned Illegal Criminals w/Obstruction of Justice\nICE had already called out Oakland's radical leftist boss for helping criminals and endangering ICE personnel by tipping them off that a raid was coming.

Because of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.\u201d\n\u201cA few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.\n\u201cLaw enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings \u2013 such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.

So, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever. Plus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.\nSecondly, the man was \u201cknown\u201d to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence. That means nothing. Known for what? The report doesn\u2019t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely. It just says he was \u201cknown.\u201d And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights.\nThirdly, what does \u201cvolume of complaints\u201d mean? How many complaints were received over a YEAR\u2019S time? Two? Five? Ten? People complaining about other people happens all of the time. Plus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.\nFourthly, there was NO report of the man \u201cexhibiting violent behavior,\u201d as the police sergeant claims. The report says \u201che had been intimidating people.\u201d How? No specifics except to say he was \u201cstaring\u201d at people. Wow! Run for your lives!\nFifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year. And the media report says the confiscations \u201conly\u201d last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended. Indeed. They could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.\nHow many defenseless (unarmed) people are robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed in a year\u2019s time? It seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.\nI tell you this with all seriousness: At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war.\nSixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn\u2019t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him \u201cafraid.\u201d\nSO WHAT?\nThat the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone \u201cafraid\u201d is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and \u201cbear\u201d arms. This \u201cI\u2019m offended\u201d or \u201chis gun scares me\u201d complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty.\nBut under this new \u201cred flag\u201d law in Washington State, police are now able to confiscate a person\u2019s firearm without the person committing ANY crime\u2014or even threatening to commit a crime. Even when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.\nGun confiscation has started in America\u2014and President Trump\u2019s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening.\nWhen Trump promised to add \u201cmental health\u201d regulations to gun purchases and ownership, he opened Pandora\u2019s Box.\nI go into the \u201cmental health\u201d trap in more detail in this column:\nTrump Set To Enact More Gun Control\n\u201cMental health\u201d regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades. Now, it is the \u201cpro-gun\u201d Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.\nKris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas. He is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School. He wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these \u201cred flag\u201d laws:\nThe seizure of guns without any hearing at all. The laws all contain an \u201cex parte\u201d provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person\u2019s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard. This is the quintessential denial of due process. The Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law. This confiscation is \u201ctemporary,\u201d but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation. Based on the testimony of one unrelated person. The confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others. The law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a \u201cfamily member.\u201d [Most of the \u201cred flag\u201d laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.] But \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined to include \u201cformer dating partners\u201d and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant. So a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner. Using a very low standard of proof. The standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low \u2013 one need only show \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the person may pose a risk. That\u2019s even lower than the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard for obtaining a search warrant. In addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing. Within two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order. But even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal trials. Rather, it need only be shown by \u201ca preponderance of evidence\u201d that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others. What kind of evidence? Things like the \u201creckless storage\u201d of firearms and drinking habits can be considered. If you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble. Shifting the burden of proof to the gun owner. The long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely. Once it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove. To have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others. Proving a negative is nearly impossible. Adding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.\nAfter the Parkland school shooting, had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control, it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular.\nInstead, Trump fell in with anti-Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control, adding \u201cmental health\u201d restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later.\nAs a result, anti-gun liberals all over the country are using Trump\u2019s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws.\nAs it stands right now, Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president, Democrat or Republican, in our lifetime.\nFreedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country. And while you are at it, don\u2019t overlook the federal Congress.\nNo wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously (and devilishly) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban (Feinstein\u2019s bill) into proposed gun control legislation.\nSee the video here:\nWatch Dianne Feinstein Erupt With Glee After Trump Seems To Endorse Her Assault Weapons Ban\nBut if you are a freedom-loving American who values your liberties and the God-given right to defend them, happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now. You should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump, and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal, State, or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms\u2014because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation.\nP.S. One more time I want to remind readers that self-defense\u2014including defense against tyrannical government\u2014is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator. For anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.\nI urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled \u201cTo Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.\u201d\nMark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical. And NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law.\nI know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns. THEY ARE WRONG. They are wrong biblically, constitutionally, and morally.\nOur book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense. I don\u2019t know of another book like it.\nWith all that is happening today, it is CRUCIAL that people (especially Christians) become familiar with the truths contained in this book. I urge you to order one for yourself and one (at least) for your friends and kinfolk.\nReprinted with permission from Chuck Baldwin.\nThe Best of Chuck Baldwin\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "Repetition", "Red_Herring", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["J Street \"Kapos\" May Un-Endorse Dem Rep Over \"Jewish Question\"\nAnti-Israel activist group J Street was very outraged when its leaders were described as \"Kapos\".

Nah, I don\u2019t have no problems with Farrakhan, I don\u2019t spend a whole lot of my time dealing with those kind of things,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s just one segment of what goes on in our world.

(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)\nRecently an editor of a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on. I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies. It\u2019s been five years, and I\u2019ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a \u201ccourageous\u201d act it was to give up the pontificate. The consequences of that act have been so outlandish \u2013 even for people who are mostly OK with Francis \u2013 that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr. Dario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation. In no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that \u201cthere is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.\u201d Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica. Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below. MJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope \u2013 a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the \u201cfilth\u201d in the Curia and throughout the church \u2013 suddenly just decide to quit? Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed? At the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did. We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before. Could we have been wrong about him? And if so, could we have been this wrong?\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d There was some implication that he didn\u2019t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn\u2019t make it to World Youth Day and similar events. The trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself. Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him? This man whom we had believed a \u201cchampion of orthodoxy,\u201d whom we thought we knew. Error, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is. How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: \u201cYour goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.\u201d Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn\u2019t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind. But this is not what we see. There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud. \u201cPerhaps it was written for him.\u201d Well, why repeat it then? Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda? If it is a deception, why participate in it?\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they \u201cmiss\u201d him have failed to respect him in one way; they won\u2019t take him at his word. Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn\u2019t valid. But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely. And indeed, far from being an isolated \u201cprisoner of the Vatican,\u201d Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism. We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn\u2019t add up, it\u2019s true. All the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?\nRatzinger: \u201cI was a bit tired and didn\u2019t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\nRatzinger: \u201cOh, there wasn\u2019t a black cassock that fit me.\u201d\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\nRatzinger: \u201cWell, I\u2019m an \u2018emeritus,\u2019 you see\u2026\u201d\nAnd where did this \u201cemeritus\u201d business come from? Does it have any precedent in Catholic history? What does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\nRatzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided \u201cmunus\u201d \u2013 with an active member and a \u201ccontemplative member\u201d? Doesn\u2019t that just mean there are two popes now?\nRatzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: \u201cHow can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?\u201d\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict. Steve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy. And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time \u2013 one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture. You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has. He walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment. And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he\u2019s the only one who won\u2019t be canonized.\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s really just that he wasn\u2019t who we thought he was.\u201d I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine. I think we made the mistake of believing the press. We were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him. We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d as the term was understood in 1962. This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council\u2019s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne. Frings\u2019 claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF \u2013 and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani \u2013 for the \u201cconservatism\u201d in the \u201cschema,\u201d the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops\u2019 discussions.\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema \u2013 that had taken years to develop \u2013 be abandoned. This was done, over Ottaviani\u2019s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French \u201cprogressives\u201d who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger \u2013 the maverick \u201cprogressive\u201d academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary \u2013 who wrote that speech.\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n\u201cJoseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card. Frings, Archbishop of Cologne. Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions. Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office. Despite a reply by Card. Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\n\u201cCard. Seper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation. Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.\u201d\nRatzinger\u2019s reputation as a \u201cprogressive\u201d is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work. It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church \u201cnever to return\u201d to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX. In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, \u201cShould the Council be revoked?\u201d and in response recommended the \u201crazing of the bastions\u201d of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word. Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian. Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty. It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength. But to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\nHis was the thesis \u2013 a mainstay of \u201cconservative\u201d ideology \u2013 that the \u201creal\u201d Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had \u201cdestroyed\u201d and would gain the media-generated reputation as an \u201carch-conservative\u201d. And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure. With the \u201carch-conservative\u201d \u201cRottweiler\u201d Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today? What did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism \u2013 that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\nWhat did \u201csilencing\u201d by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity \u201cpriest-theologian,\u201d courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism? Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy? Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree? Precious few.\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith \u2013 academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world \u2013 with never a peep of protest from Rome. Moreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the \u201carch-conservative\u201d John Paul II and the \u201cRottweiler\u201d Benedict XVI pontificates.\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy? Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement? The \u201cprogressive\u201d destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet \u201carch-conservative\u201d\u2026\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions. He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological \u201cleft\u201d after the 1960s while he stayed in place. Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this. Perhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called \u201cprogressive\u201d in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a \u201cchampion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy\u201d by 2005.\nIs this why he resigned? Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it? Perhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the \u201cliberal\u201d European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops\u2019 palace of Milan in June 2012. Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy. Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia. By 2012, this had proved impossible.\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini \u2013 the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the \u201cliberal wing\u201d of European Catholicism? I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger. They were esteemed academic colleagues. They were brothers of the episcopate. They were members of the club. Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative. Why wouldn\u2019t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these \u201cconservative\u201d prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals. It beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope. Jorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the \u201cultra-liberal\u201d \u201cwing\u201d of the post-Vatican II Church.\nIn an article on the cardinal\u2019s life\u2019s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict. The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper\u2019s work as Bergoglio\u2019s. This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another \u201cSankt Gallen\u201d member. This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn\u2019t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear? Why was he not \u2013 at the very least \u2013 given the same \u201csilencing\u201d treatment as Kung? Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic. But it\u2019s a simple truth: he\u2019s a heretic. Everyone knows he\u2019s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal. Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF in 1993. But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way. Nor was he removed from places of influence. Far from it. In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue. In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the \u201cecumenical\u201d office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign. In 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal. And, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger\u2019s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age. But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election. (As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\nExcuse me Maike, but I don\u2019t think this is a parenthetical issue. Is it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope \u201cEmeritus\u201d Benedict \u2013 whatever you want to call yourself \u2013 I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal? Why is he still a bishop? Why is he still allowed to call himself a \u201cCatholic theologian\u201d? Why did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\nDoesn\u2019t anyone else want to know this? Don\u2019t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest? Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing? Why a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated? What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads? My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle\u2019s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami\u2019s Favalora, Rochester\u2019s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool\u2026 I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church. Why have we so often seen these men \u2013 compromised intellectually and morally \u2013 elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\nThe end of \u201cBig Umbrella Catholicism\u201d\nThe New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions. Maike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation \u2013 in which each, of the so-called \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: \u201cIt was characteristic of the church\u2019s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.\u201d\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being \u2013 as his Wikipedia page puts it \u2013 \u201cone of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.\u201d And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we\u2019re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times. There\u2019s a \u201cliberal wing\u201d and a \u201cconservative wing\u201d and they\u2019re both Catholic.\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole \u201cemeritus pope\u201d charade was an error: \u201cI think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error. By playing along, by pretending that we could be \u201cconservative Catholics\u201d in this New Paradigm that also includes \u201cliberal Catholics\u201d we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church\u2019s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a \u201cbig umbrella\u201d with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal \u201ctaste\u201d \u2026that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which \u201cconservatives\u201d have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a \u201cconservative champion of orthodoxy.\u201d And what has this achieved? It created cover for the men of Kasper\u2019s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\nAnd just like that, the jargon of \u201ctolerance\u201d and the \u201cbig umbrella\u201d is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun. As it had to. They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand \u2013 and frequently say out loud \u2013 that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same. And their New Church is the only one left.\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don\u2019t talk about it, there isn\u2019t a problem. Ottaviani\u2019s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church \u2013 and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger. We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\nOne of the things I\u2019ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era. We were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the \u201cNew Springtime of Vatican II,\u201d while we watched these wolves in shepherds\u2019 clothing eating the sheep.\nNow we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness. For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn\u2019t a shock, he isn\u2019t even a surprise; he\u2019s just the logical end result. This pontificate isn\u2019t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.\n", ["Conversation_Killer", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Trump fires Tillerson, replaces with former top spook\nFollowing what has appeared for months to be a strained relationship between President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the top diplomat is being replaced.\nTrump announced Tillerson\u2019s ouster via Twitter Tuesday, saying: \u201cMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.

Trump told reporters Tuesday that he ultimately decided to fire the secretary because they disagreed over strategy in key areas of foreign policy, such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the approach to North Korea and the overall tone of U.S. diplomacy. Tillerson said he received a call from Trump around noon Tuesday, more than three hours after his firing was first reported by The Washington Post and announced minutes later in a tweet from the president. His voice quivering, Tillerson thanked career diplomats for their \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and the American people for \u201cacts of kindness,\u201d and he singled out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for their partnership and mutual support of diplomacy. But he notably did not thank Trump or praise his policies. Tillerson said he will remain in his post until March 31 but is delegating all authorities for running the State Department to Deputy Secretary John Sullivan and is committed to ensuring \u201can orderly and smooth transition.\u201d The deposed diplomat also made a clear statement about Russian aggression: \u201cMuch work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government.\u201d\n\ufeff\nCNBC reports that Tillerson was not the only firing that took place on Tuesday:\nOn Tuesday morning, State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said Tillerson had no plans to leave.

Two White House officials told the Associated Press that Tillerson found out he was fired Friday. The secretary got a call from White House chief of staff John Kelly but only got told an unspecified presidential tweet concerning him may be coming, officials at the State Department told the wire service. Later, the White House fired Goldstein, who contradicted the administration\u2019s account of Tillerson\u2019s ouster, according to NBC News and the AP. Goldstein was the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.

Pompeo has advocated for regime change in North Korea. We've seen exactly what happens when the US gets involved in such types of regime changes, and the truth is that they really don't work out too well.\nAs for Haspel, Paul told \"Face The Nation,\" \"She oversaw an illegal black ops operation in Thailand that included torture. I don't think torture is what America is about.\"\nOn \"State of the Union,\" Paul added, \"I'll do whatever it takes, and that includes filibuster\" to block their confirmation.\n\"I don't have the power to stop her nomination,\" he said of Haspel. \"There's enough votes she'll eventually win. Few things in life . . . [are] worth standing up saying 'enough is enough.'\"\n\"We are not a people that should be so fearful or vengeful that we think that torture is somehow acceptable,\" he added. \"On what level could torture ever be acceptable? We should make a stand on this. She should never lead the CIA.\"\nBoth nominations may face tough confirmation hearings, but it seems that many Americans are just fine with these types of people being in these types of offices. The only thing I can think for that kind of reasoning is that people do not know their Constitution and understand exactly what Senator Paul is trying to warn America about. Instead, people are acting out of emotion and fear.\nDo I believe we should be concerned about North Korea? Sure, but I'm hardly worried that they will actually attack us. Am I concerned about jihadis? Yep, but I'm not sure I've seen any real hard evidence that torturing them has produced any information that has led to stopping terror attacks.\nAnd before you tell me about the media reports and CIA involvement, just keep in mind that a former journalist, who is now dead, told the world that the media lies for the CIA. So, I'm wary of media reports that claim there have been results from the tactics used.\nTrump has obviously had praise for both Pompeo and Haspel, but then again, his administration has quite a bit of turn over too.\nMike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! \u2014 Donald J.

The Daily Caller News Foundation was present at the court hearing.\nAssociates and relatives have long accused the family of green. \u201cFor the sake of money they would have done anything,\u201d Gilani\u2019s cousin, Syed Ahmed, told the Daily Mail. \u201cThere are possibilities that [Imran] or them might have been selling [House] information,\u201d he added. (Syed Ahmed knew Abid well enough to loan him money, according to bankruptcy documents filed by Abid.)\nThe FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family\u2019s activities involving House computers. \u201cBased on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time\u201d and \u201cthere are strong indications of flight in this case,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nAbid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy. On Nov. 16, 2016, the brothers made a video of his bedridden father signing over ownership \u2014 but not changing the beneficiary \u2014 of his life insurance policy to Abid.\nAbid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary. When his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani\u2019s lawyer said would have kept her from the money. A Virginia court later ruled that Jamal\u2019s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong.\n\u201cWhy is that even relevant?\u201d Bacon said of Jamal\u2019s misstatement at the March 7 court date.\nOn Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi \u2013 who was also on the House payroll \u2013 began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses. In January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan.\nImran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment. On Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.\nThe life insurance change\u2019s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it. Ten weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company.\nIn addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless. Abid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors. At that time, he filed forms \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d that two houses were needed as \u201cmy spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.\u201d\nHowever, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova \u2013 who also was on the House payroll \u2013 signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as \u201cspouse of Abid,\u201d and they have been photographed living together.\nGilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to \u201cassets of my late husband in Pakistan,\u201d which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy.\nAmerico, the life insurance company, said there was \u201cgreat doubt\u201d about who the rightful policy holder was, given the allegations of fraud, and sent the decision to the courts to sort out on April 14, two months after the House sargent-at-arms banned the Awans for \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d\nGilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband\u2019s possessions. The only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships. He lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents.\nHadeed did not introduce any evidence to the judge about a pattern of possible fraud by Abid, the timing of the move as it relates to the federal criminal case, or the mental capacity of the dying man to understand paperwork. Hadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language.\nAfter court, Hadeed told reporters Bacon had threatened to sue him for defamation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to subject myself to that,\u201d he said outside court. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.\u201d\nIn court, Bacon badgered Hadeed. \u201cAre you going to share any more info with them?

Infected bats are believed to transmit the disease to humans, or indirectly through other animals that are hunted for their meat.\nThe family of the first victim of the 2014 outbreak, a two-year-old child, hunted bats and it is believed bushmeat was the origin of the outbreak.\nAn estimated five million tonnes of bushmeat is consumed on the continent every year, according to the Centre for International Forestry Research.\nThe virus then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments.

Ambassador John Bolton.\nFor over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran. Now, he\u2019s the National Security Advisor.\nIt just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran.\n\u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today. I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran. The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself. And that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d\nPay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran\u2019s current regime \u201cis centered in this room today.\u201d Who was in that room? Well, the entire event was actually put on by the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.\nAs Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.\nFor decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.\nTo recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012\u2014which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for \u201cregime change\u201d on their behalf\u2014is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane. To see what US intervention\u2014through military support and the support of opposition groups\u2014does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America\u2019s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump\u2019s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report. This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n\u201cThis is a memo that describes how we\u2019re going to take out seven countries in five years,\u201d Clark said. \u201cStarting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.\u201d\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.

The three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime. The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009. The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House.\nAh, yes, John Bolton. While I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision.\n\"The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,\" SSG writes in the paper. \"This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months.\"\nWell, why is that? It's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US. As has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions.\nI'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government. Honestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against.\nStill, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran:\n\u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today. I had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran. The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself. And that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d\nAnd again, this really has nothing to do with the US.\nOne source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime\u2019s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change.\n\u201cThe JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue. \u201cPrior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism. It\u2019s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo\u2019s job to put this consensus back in place.\u201d\nThe source told the Beacon that Bolton is \u201cacutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.\u201d\n\u201cJohn is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you\u2019re never going to fundamentally change its behavior\u2014and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially\u2014until that revolutionary regime is gone,\u201d the source said, adding that \u201cnothing\u2019s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.\u201d\nOK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here. Those they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it. There is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way.\nWhy should we be fighting a battle or encouraging, funding, and I'm quite sure arming, a rebellion? Where is that authorized in our Constitution? Simple. It isn't.\nI care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9-11 hijackers came from. The Iranian government I care for even less, but out of each of those, which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9-11? Both, if you're going to go by information that we have a record on.\nWhy can't America focus on it's own issues and solve those? It's because we are too busy trying to police the world, keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt.\nAnd lest you think this is about the nuclear deal. It isn't.\n\u201cThe problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it\u2019s the Iranian regime,\u201d the source told the Beacon. \u201cTeam Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem. President Trump hired him knowing all of that. The administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.\u201d\nBolton says it will be accomplished in the next six months. I don't doubt it.\nThis will probably end up being another Ukraine situation, something we just don't need to be in, and yes, I know, I'll be called a liberal but honest readers who have followed me for some time know that's not the case.\nNotice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.\n\u201cMore than one third of Iran\u2019s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,\u201d the paper explains. \u201cU.S. support for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.\u201d\n\u201cThe probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,\u201d the plan states. \u201cAbsent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.\u201d\nPresident Trump did made clear earlier in the week that we must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime. Well, I agree, but that gets real messy when you start intervening in this manner.\n\u201cAny public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,\u201d according to the plan. \u201cWe must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.\u201d\nBut the Trump administration has spoken out on other countries where the people want their independence. Remember the Kurds? How about the people in the Catalan region of Spain? No support for those people, and why? Cause it's not part of the agenda.\nI say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight. Then, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then.\n", ["Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Trump\u2019s Plan for Iran: Put Terrorists in Charge?\nBack in the 2008 presidential race, I explained to then-candidate Rudy Giuliani the concept of \u201cblowback.\u201d Years of US meddling and military occupation of parts of the Middle East motivated a group of terrorists to carry out attacks against the United States on 9/11.

Like the rest of the neocons, he either doesn\u2019t get it or doesn\u2019t want to get it. In a recent speech to the MeK \u2013 a violent Islamist-Marxist cult that spent two decades on the US terror watch list \u2013 Giuliani promised that the Trump Administration had made \u201cregime change\u201d a priority for Iran. He even told the members of that organization \u2013 an organization that has killed dozens of Americans \u2013 that Trump would put them in charge of Iran!\nGiuliani shares with numerous other neocons like John Bolton a strong relationship with this group. In fact, both Giuliani and Bolton have been on the payroll of the MeK and have received tens of thousands of dollars to speak to their followers. This is another example of how foreign lobbies and special interest groups maintain an iron grip on our foreign policy.\nDoes anyone really think Iran will be better off if Trump puts a bunch of \u201cformer\u201d terrorists in charge of the country? How did that work in Libya?\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the bombastic Giuliani as he speaks to his financial benefactors in the MeK. Unfortunately, however, Giuliani\u2019s claims were confirmed late last week, when the Washington Free Beacon published a three-page policy paper being circulated among National Security Council officials containing plans to spark regime change in Iran.\nThe paper suggests that the US focus on Iran\u2019s many ethnic minority groups to spark unrest and an eventual overthrow of the government. This is virtually the same road map that the US has followed in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and so on. The results have been unmitigated disaster after disaster.\nUnleashing terrorists on Iran to overthrow its government is not only illegal and immoral: it\u2019s also incredibly stupid. We know from 9/11 that blowback is real, even if Giuliani and the neocons refuse to understand it. Iran does not threaten the United States. Unlike Washington\u2019s Arab allies in the region, Iran actually holds reasonably democratic elections and has a Western-oriented, educated, and very young population.\nWhy not open up to Iran with massive amounts of trade and other contacts? Does anyone (except for the neocons) really believe it is better to unleash terrorists on a population than to engage them in trade and travel?

Rich Penkoski, a Christian parent and founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ, raised alarms over a packet on Islam his daughter\u2019s seventh grade social studies teacher issued to students, according to Christian Post. The packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy \u2014 an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski\u2019s daughter. The Shahada states: \u201cThere is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.\u201d Penkoski called Mountain Ridge Middle School Principal Ron Branch and objected to the packet, saying it disturbed him and had misinformation about the history of calligraphy. \u201cI saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic. Their excuse was calligraphy,\u201d Penkoski told The Christian Post. \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\u2019 First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad. The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018That is not happening. My daughter is not doing that.\u2019 My daughter told me that if she didn\u2019t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,\u201d Penkoski added\u2026. There were two different calligraphy assignments \u2014 one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post. Hinson \u201ctold the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another. She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,\u201d Branch added. Penkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint \u2014 this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment. Penkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone. \u201cI said, \u2018This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.\u2019 The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn\u2019t have to do it. My daughter conflicted that story and said, \u2018No, that is not what was said.\u2019 What was said was, \u2018Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,\u2019\u201d Penkoski told Christian Post. Each religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received \u201cequitable treatment,\u201d Branch also told Christian Post. He said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism \u2014 other religions took one week \u2014 and discussed each religion\u2019s beliefs, history and practices. During the section on Christianity, \u201cJesus was taught,\u201d Branch claimed. \u201cThe students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation. They also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus\u2019 Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord\u2019s Prayer, among other topics,\u201d Branch said. Penkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch\u2019s claims. The Lord\u2019s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post. \u201cWe did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days. We watched two different videos. We didn\u2019t finish them. They taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,\u201d Brielle explained. \u201cWe learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans. We were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.\u201d Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version. While the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said. \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d he said. \u201c[There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,\u201d he added\u2026.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["The Islamization of the Public Schools\nMuslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism. With the imperative to be \u201ctolerant\u201d robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically, all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S.-based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor, Saudi Arabia, to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines.\nMany of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded. They make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro-Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing.\nThe taboo about teaching religion in the public schools, so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades, is increasingly set aside in American public schools, as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.\u201d He said that Christianity and Judaism were given \u201cequitable treatment\u201d in the same class.\nPenkoski\u2019s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam. Penkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer. [There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.\u201d\nThis stealth proselytizing is nationwide. Last January, parents filed a federal complaint against Chatham Middle School in Chatham, New Jersey, for forcing students to watch videos that proselytized for Islam. One video, according to the complaint, describes \u201cChristians and Jews as \u2018infidels\u2019 and prais[es] Muhammad in gruesome detail for slaughtering them.\u201d Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as \u201creplete with biased, chastising statements encouraging the students\u2026to follow the Quran and become Muslim.\u201d Another video, according to Hilsenrath, depicts a Muslim boy teaching his non-Muslim friend about Islam, after which both go to \u201clearn how to pray.\u201d\nThe complaint adds: \u201cDue to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.\u201d\nThese accounts are not singular. High school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, \u201cpretended to be Muslims in the \u2018Islamic\u2019 city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.\u201d The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article. Judicial Watch Senior Investigator Bill Marshall remarked: \u201cCitizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d Dr. Bill Saxton, chairman of Citizens for National Security, said that the assignment was a \u201cpurposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the \u2018virtues\u2019 of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: \u201cMy daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,\u201d while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments. One homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: \u201cAllah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,\u201d with students having to fill in the blank with \u201csame God.\u201d\nParent Steve Alsup added: \u201cIt seemed like half the truth to me, they didn\u2019t talk about the extreme Islamics.\u201d Kim Embry, a spokesperson for Walton County Public Schools, said revealingly: \u201cWe are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching.\u201d\nIndeed. In 2015, students at Spring Hill Middle School in Spring Hill, Tennessee were forced as part of an assignment to write, \u201cThere is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d Mother Joy Ellis remarked: \u201cThis is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP. I didn\u2019t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.\u201d Another mother, Brandee Porterfield, observed: \u201cIt really did bother me that they skipped the whole chapter on the rise of Christianity and they spent three weeks just studying Islam\u2026.I spoke with the teacher and the principal,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter. Even though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.\u201d\nMaury County Director of Schools, Chris Marczak, defended the curriculum: \u201cIt is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate.\u201d Porterfield, however, shot back: \u201cThey are not going over anything else. So for the students to have to memorize this prayer, it does seem like it is indoctrination.\u201d\nNone of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise. Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one\u2019s own. The embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill. Certainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way. They would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism.\nUnfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Name_Calling-Labeling", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["Not So Fast\nIt\u2019s got to be either one of the stupidest acts that I can recall or a very wicked plan by Washington neocons to sabotage Korean peace talks.\nHow else to describe the decision by Big Brother USA and junior sidekick South Korea to stage major air force exercises on North Korea\u2019s border.

The vaccination campaign will begin today.\n\u201cThe vaccination campaign begins tomorrow, Monday, in Mbandaka, capital of the province,\u201d Minister of Health Oly Ilunga told The Associated Press as reported by 9 News Australia. \u201cIt will target, first, the health staff, the contacts of the sick and the contacts of the contacts.\u201d The World Health Organization has been warning about the \u201cEbola situation\u201d in Congo, and it appears their only solution is an experimental vaccine.\nAn experimental vaccine is one that has never been tried on humans before.\nEbola hemorrhagic fever, seen mostly only in Africa, is one of the world\u2019s most feared diseases. It begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Days later, some victims begin bleeding through the nose, mouth, and eyes. Depending on the strain of the Ebola virus, it can kill up to 90% of victims. There is no cure for Ebola. The virus is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person.\nSo, is the Ebola virus reaching a terrifying enough level that an experimental vaccine is warranted? The death toll has reached 26 and the vaccine will be rolled out at Mbandaka, the north-western city of 1.2 million recently struck by the outbreak. Since the virus is spread through direct contact, an isn\u2019t airborne, it isn\u2019t nearly as deadly as it could be.\nRead more here about Ebola and how it is transmitted:\nInitially, the campaign will target 600 people, mainly medical staff, contacts of suspected cases, and those who have been in contact with the contacts, Ilunga said. Officials are working urgently to prevent the disease from spreading beyond Mbandaka, which lies on the Congo River, a busy traffic corridor, and is an hour\u2019s flight from the capital.\nThe spread of Ebola from a rural area to Mbandaka has raised alarm as Ebola can spread more quickly in urban centers. The fever can cause severe internal bleeding that is often fatal. Meaning, the virus itself doesn\u2019t actually kill. The immune system\u2019s response to the virus is what\u2019s deadly.\nZMapp is also an experimental drug that could aid in the recovery from the Ebola virus. But, like the vaccine being administered, it has not been tested for safety or efficacy yet. It is not a vaccine \u2013 it is a therapeutic drug. Of the seven people given the drug so far, two have died. ZMapp show \u201cpromise,\u201d although scientific results are not definitive.\nThe risk of Ebola spreading within Congo is \u201cvery high,\u201d according to authorities, and the disease could also move into nine neighboring countries, the World Health Organization has warned. The WHO, however, stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global health emergency. WHO said there should not be restrictions on international travel or trade.\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s important to prevent oneself from contracting the virus. Unfortunately, health care workers are at the greatest risk as they try to cull the suffering: which is why they will be the first to get the experimental vaccine.

Contemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end. It has no \u201cuse\u201d in the sense that either the Bergoglians \u2013 in terms of their political machinations \u2013 or the world can understand. There is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.\nOne aspect of Pope Francis\u2019 character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life \u2013 a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church\u2019s undertakings. The world does not understand it or want it. Therefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it. So when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .\nIn his recent document, ostensibly on holiness, \u201cGaudete et Exultate,\u201d the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude, to be alone with God in prayer, seeking unity with Him, saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism, about material, worldly ends. To these foundations of the contemplative life \u2013 indeed of any form of religious life in the Church \u2013 Francis set up another of his false dichotomies, contemplation in opposition to serving others, giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics: \u201cWe are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action, and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission.\u201d\nItalian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, \u201cRejoice and be glad\u2026 but not if you\u2019re a cloistered contemplative.\u201d\nIn 2016, I wrote that Francis\u2019 Apostolic Constitution, \u201cVultum dei quaerere\u201d was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking-ball pontificate to date. Unfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed. Aimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.\nThe new document issued last week, \u201cCor orans,\u201d is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules \u2013 289 of them! \u2013 that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.\nOne odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:\n\u201cA monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.\u201d (emphasis added)\nWait\u2026 its \u201cusefulness\u201d? I think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, \u201cAccording to what specific criteria is a monastery\u2019s \u2018usefulness\u2019 actually determined?\u201d\nOne can\u2019t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe. A house that could prove to the secularists that it was \u201cuseful\u201d \u2013 that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick \u2013 would be allowed to continue. Those which were purely contemplative \u2013 a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God \u2013 were closed.\nIt is not an insignificant quirk of modern history, and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate, that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes, from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union.\nRupture? What rupture?\nThe first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology. In the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a \u201chermeneutic of continuity\u201d with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950. The authors insist there is no contradiction between the two \u2013 except, of course, where there are contradictions \u2013 and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the \u201caim of their specific vocation.\u201d It describes Francis as promulgating this document \u201cin the wake\u201d of Pius XII[1].\nIn fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points. As a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.\nBut of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\nYes, that\u2019s what it said.\nHere\u2019s my translation:\n\u201cThe Church\u2019s \u2018path\u2019 of the last 50 years has been \u2018fruitful\u2019. How do you know? Because we\u2019re telling you it has.\u201d\nIn other words, there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II. Everything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church; there has been no rupture or break with the past. All changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - \u201cfruitful\u201d if, perhaps, a bit \u201cintense\u201d \u2013 and have been made in \u201clight of the teachings\u201d of Vatican II and \u201cchanged socio-cultural conditions.\u201d There is, therefore, no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to \u201cturn back the clock\u201d to the pre-Vatican II norms or styles of religious life. Anyone attempting to do this are Bad Nuns [insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here.]\nThis is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; \u201cNothing to see here. And if you say there is, you\u2019re the problem.\u201d\nOf course, this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out. It\u2019s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they\u2019ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren\u2019t any. After all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.\nThe irony, of course, is built in, since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop. Why would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?\nLet\u2019s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de\u2019Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo. This is the Cardinal Braz de\u2019Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor \u2013 and by extension Pope Benedict \u2013 to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US. He complained that he had been shut out of the process under Cardinal Rode, and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world. Apparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life \u2013 always claimed to be \u201cmandated\u201d by \u201cthe Council\u201d.\nAnd of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a \u201crestorationist\u201d community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him \u201cworry.\u201d Apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern Church; the gaunt spectre of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Immaculate haunts this document.\nAutonomy vs. Independence\nOne of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of \u201cautonomy\u201d of monasteries. Many of the headlines crowed: \u201cVatican confirms nuns\u2019 autonomy,\u201d or similar. But that word does not mean what they think it means. In fact, the word \u201cautonomy\u201d is the key to understanding this whole thing. It appears in the document 16 times and \u201cautonomous\u201d 30 times.\nIn fact, \u201cautonomy\u201d is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery\u2019s viability. This emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the \u201cfruitful\u201d post-conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out\u2026 for\u2026 some reason\u2026\nMonastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that, having the requisites for real autonomy of life, was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law.\n18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns, it must presuppose a real autonomy of life, that is, the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions (vocational, formative, governmental, relational, liturgical, economic ...). In this case, an autonomous monastery is alive and vital.\n43 Autonomy of life, a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy, must be constantly verified by the Federal President who, when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life, must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission.\n67 Affiliation [with another monastery, appointed by the Vatican] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised. If the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\nno longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See. When an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.\nAt the same time, this document is redefining the term \u201cautonomous\u201d to exclude independence. What got no mention in the brief press interest was the document\u2019s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate \u201cautonomy\u201d they will be granted little in the way of powers of self-governance.\nAs we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:\novercome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life. Federation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.\nNote the change: \u201cindependent\u201d is replaced with \u201cisolated[5].\u201d It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK. She said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery\u2019s federation, was excessive and not helpful. She didn\u2019t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate\u2019s suitability for religious life, so she didn\u2019t require these tests of her monastery\u2019s postulants. She also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation\u2019s leadership. Was that monastery \u201cisolated\u201d? Or just exercising lawful self-governance?\nAnd given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery, it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism, or even to the Catholic Faith, a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time. The word \u201cfidelity\u201d appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.\nFunny you should mention autonomy: Bioethics and the dissolution of \u201cunviable\u201d monasteries\nIt\u2019s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be \u201cautonomy\u201d. As we shall see, the document is what I\u2019ve called above a \u201cchopping block\u201d. Vultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.\nNote the language used here:\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\nIt jogged a memory for me. \u201cIncapacity\u201d\u2026 Where had I heard that language used before? Most pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the \u201cMental Capacity Act\u201d of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently \u201creduced capacity\u201d could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors.\nThis is the world, the language, of Bioethics, applied utilitarianism, also called \u201cPrinciplism\u201d after its three bioethical criteria of \u201cjustice, beneficence[6] and autonomy\u201d \u2013 it is a patient\u2019s ability to demonstrate his \u201cautonomy\u201d or \u201cquality of life,[7]\u201d either currently or potentially, that decides his fate. This set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a \u201cnew paradigm\u201d of ethics replacing traditional \u201cHippocratic\u201d or \u201cNatural Law\u201d medical ethics.\nUnder this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment \u2013 of continuing to live. Medical treatment (which legally includes food and water) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle.\nHealth care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out \u201cguidelines\u201d to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated. These guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria. If the equation doesn\u2019t come out in the patient\u2019s favour, the \u201ctreatment\u201d recommended for the patient\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives. The NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.\nThe result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors. In one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated. The system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.\nKeep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document. I think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term \u201cpatient\u201d with \u201cmonastery.\u201d Think about how one would apply concepts like \u201cautonomy,\u201d \u201cviability,\u201d \u201cincapacity,\u201d \u201cquality of life\u201d and \u201cequitable distribution of scarce resources\u201d to this context.\nWhen the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life, one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails.\nFederations as Vatican watchdogs\nUnder this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation. Previously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.\nThe document makes it inarguable that the federation\u2019s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme \u2013 the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d of the Church since 1965 \u2013 both within the various orders and between them:\nThe Federal Assembly:\ndeals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;\nMore than just federations; a multi-tier system of control\nConference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries, belonging to diverse Institutes and present in the same region... in particular geographical or linguistic contexts.\nIn other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a \u201cConference\u201d with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc. This will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the \u201cconservative\u201d end of things. Imagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings \u2013 and attempting to keep up their Office schedule \u2013 with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans\u2026What fun!\nAnd finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:\nConfederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.\nBroad powers\nFederations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns. It is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to \u201cencourage\u201d individual monasteries to \u201ccommunicate\u201d their goods.\nThe legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.\nTo keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.\nThe communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.\nThe Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.\nFinancial incentives\nGiven that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like \u201cvitality in living and transmitting the charism\u201d and \u201cdynamic fidelity\u201d to the order\u2019s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8]. Since the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.\nArticle 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek \u201clegal recognition also in the civil sphere.\u201d This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.\nArticle 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:\nIn the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.\nThe economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.\nFederations in charge of formation\nThe Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time. At the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.\nThe formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.\nThe President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.\nWho makes new foundations and why?\nThroughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses. Now, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.\nthrough the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no. 39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]\nA single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be \u201chelped\u201d and guided by the federation:\nIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery. The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\nArticle 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that \u201cmust be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.\u201d\nthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,\u201d composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, \u201cas long as most are not of advanced age\u201d. a) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with \u201c\u201d composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, \u201cas long as most are not of advanced age\u201d.\nb) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.\nc) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.\nd) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.\nOne of these things is not like the others. Did you notice? One criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards. One aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance. If a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a \u201cloophole\u201d. Or it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.\nSo, how, exactly, is it to be determined \u2013 and by whom \u2013 that a group of nuns possess \u201cthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism\u201d? What, precisely, does the term \u201cvitality\u201d mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?\nIs this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning? Like the secret to how nuns are to smile properly? Does the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document? Or is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates? The next article tells us, \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.\u201d Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures \u201ccharism vitality\u201d?\nIt seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:\nAmong the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].\nYou will be affiliated; resistance is futile\u2026\nIt seems there are two themes running through the document: to establish a certain value of \u201cautonomy\u201d as the indispensable criterion for viability, while at the same time asserting top-down oversight and control over who gets to make this determination. In short, a monastery must be autonomous, but heaven help the community that asserts its independence.\nArticles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of \u201cincapacity\u201d that is really just more of the second thing. Once a lack of autonomy has been established\u2026\n54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.\n55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible, helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery.\nHow does affiliation work? Well, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:\nIn these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery\nIt\u2019s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the Big Brother hit-squad of the Congregation for Religious. It\u2019s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men\u2019s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices. Mariawald Trappist monastery \u2013 900 years old \u2013 was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.\nIts superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring \u2013 in 2008, after the publication of Summorum Pontificum \u2013 that the monastery\u2019s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after Vatican II, and that clearly the solution was to go back to pre-conciliar ways. Mariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.\nWhat would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices:\n60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.\u201d\nOf course, this means it is the affiliating monastery\u2019s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, \u201cneo-pelagian\u201d postulants and novices.\n~\nThis brings us to about article 155 of the document. Part two to come.\n_______________\n[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis\u2019 Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison. I\u2019m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.\n[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the \u201cconservative,\u201d not Francis, who appointed Braz de\u2019 Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode \u2013 presumably under that good old \u201cconservative\u201d rubric of the \u201cbig umbrella\u201d \u2013 under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.\n[3] Just considering the numbers of course. Leaving alone the doctrinal issues.\n[4] \u201cThe same Institute\u201d means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.\n[5] I\u2019d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell Rome, \u201cActually, given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neo-modernist heretics, if not schismatics, we think \u2018isolation\u2019 is a desirable thing \u2013 like quarantine during an outbreak of Bubonic Plague \u2013 and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement.\u201d I\u2019d pay good money to see the shade of purple the well-fed Braz de\u2019Aviz turned.\n[6] \u201cjustice and beneficence\u201d are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient\n[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient \u201cquality\u201d it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy. Dependence upon the care of others is, quite literally, a capital offence.\n[8] Readers may think I\u2019m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of \u201ctens of millions\u201d of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head. Shortly after Carballo\u2019s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor\u2019s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running. Carballo was Francis\u2019 very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.\n[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity. I can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.\n[10] We\u2019ll pass over \u201cdynamic fidelity\u201d in silence for now\u2026\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Straw_Man", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["American in China injured in 'sonic attack' similar to Cuba\n\u00a9 Provided by Al Jazeera Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was moving medical teams to China over the 'sonic attack' [Leah Millis/ Reuters]\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a brain injury sustained by an American official in a \"sonic attack\" in China was similar to those that affected US and Canadian diplomats in Cuba.\nPompeo's remarks on Wednesday came hours after the US embassy in China issued a health warning to Americans living there over an \"unusual\" auditory or sensory phenomena.\nThe embassy said a US government employee in the southern city of Guangzhou reported experiencing a \"subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure\", which led to a mild brain injury.\nPompeo told the House Foreign Affairs Committee the \"sonic attack\" in China was similar to the incidents in Cuba last year.\n\"The medical indications are very similar and entirely consistent with the medical indications that have taken place to Americans working in Cuba,\" he said.\nThe US was moving medical teams to the area to work on the case, he said.\n\"We are working to figure out what took place both in Havana and now in China as well,\" Pompeo said.\nChina's foreign ministry did not comment immediately.\nHeather Nauert, the state department spokeswoman, said the US embassy learned on Friday that the Guangzhou employee showed concussion symptoms after medical testing.\nThat is the same clinical finding doctors treating the Cuba patients at the University of Philadelphia found.\nThe Guangzhou worker started experiencing \"a variety of symptoms\" starting in late 2017 that lasted through April this year, Nauert said.\nThe worker was sent to the US for further evaluation, she added.\nIn Cuba last year, 24 diplomats and their family members were left with mysterious injuries resembling brain trauma, which were suspected of being caused by a \"sonic attack\".\nTen Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered similar illnesses.\nThe still-unexplained incidents sparked a rift in US-Cuban relations, while investigators have chased theories including a sonic attack, an electromagnetic weapon, or a flawed spying device.\nSymptoms, sounds and sensations reportedly varied dramatically from person to person, according to The Associated Press.\nSome have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing.

The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her. Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported. In April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. Though House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later. In the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared. Though Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing. In January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported. Abid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators. In one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI. BACON Q: [redacted] is your email address, isn\u2019t it? And you send emails from that address including two emails to the FBI, didn\u2019t you?\nGILANI A: Yes, a long time ago.\nQ: No, not a long time ago. March 5th, 2017. March 6th, 2017.

He sent me the packets the school gave out for the Jewish and the Christian lessons and commented:\nNotice no bible verses, no reciting the 10 commandments or the Lord\u2019s prayer. No practicing writing in Hebrew (not even the 10 commandments) as compared to the Islamic packet. There are no statements of faith, nothing asking the students to write it or practice in any of the Jewish or Christian rituals. Furthermore the principal of Mountain Ridge Middle School Dr. Branch has used my words against me by saying the teacher did tell the students about the Lord\u2019s prayer (my daughter as well as 1 other said this is false)[.] He is using my arguments I made to him yesterday to protect the teacher. The teacher today told the students the assignment was optional. My daughter as well as other students were under the impression all the packet assignments were mandatory (the Jewish one and the Christian ones were mandatory). I wrote to Dr. Branch to share with him the resource that Miss Hinson used and point out that the material she gave the students did not include all the faith aspects for Christianity. The students received 2 pages for Christianity from this resource while all the Islamic sections were left intact. Here\u2019s the link for you to review. You will notice all the faith elements were left out for Judaism and Christianity while the Islamic section was left the way it\u2019s presented. https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf So she decided to use the extra resources for Islam and the school is saying that\u2019s not indoctrination or proselytizing? The faith aspects and the same considerations were not given to the others as they were for Islam. This actually further proves my point that Islam was afforded special privilege over the others. The school is backtracking and being deceptive to try and weasel out of this. The teacher today clarified things for the students but that still does not excuse the fact that they are teaching the Islamic faith and asking the kids to participate in Sharia. Look at the Islamic packet again. They are asking the kids to write the beginning of Surahs. The teacher still has not corrected the error that calligraphy was started by the arabs. They are doubling down and only after being called on it are they trying to backtrack.\nRich Penkoski is hardly the first to protest this egregious submission to the most vicious and brutal ideology on the face of the Earth. In Volusia County, Florida, hundreds protested Islamic lessons in their \u201cWorld History\u201d text, a Common Core-approved high school history textbook.\nWith an entire chapter dedicated to the virtues of Islam and not a single chapter for Christianity, the textbook had Floridians in a frenzy. And who is the biggest pusher of Common Core besides leftist progressives? The Islamic Society of North America, a Muslim Brotherhood front group, along with the Hamas-tied Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). In Florida, CAIR is on the offensive (more here).\nWe have seen the increasing Islamization of the public-school curriculum. History lessons in Islam are dawah \u2013 proselytizing for Islam. Large public-school publishers have been bought by the Saudis.\nIn West Virginia, it gets even worse. Rich Penkoski has alerted me to the latest development in the forced Islamization of his children\u2019s school curriculum: after the Daily Caller and Geller Report exposed what was happening, Mountain Ridge administrators and teachers began messaging parents who were sharing the story, asking them to remove their posts.\nWhat do they have to hide? Apparently, a great deal.\nWorse still, Penkoski is now being threatened by students who attend the school with his daughter. (And who is behind them? Unidentified \u201cadult friends.\u201d)\nHe sent this message to me:\nA student in the school threatened to get her adult friends to come to my home and kill me by stabbing me in the chest and ripping my organs out. They told my daughter \u201cwe are gonna get some people and kill your dad.\u201d This student, who is known to me but whom I cannot name because she is a minor, has given students our address and is encouraging them to come to my home over this whole thing. Another student told my daughter that she and the first student and her adult friends are going to kill me and carve a satanic star in my chest and rip out my organs. They then threatened to hang my 3-year-old and 1-year-old and kidnap my 14-year-old. All this in school today because of the articles. This is not a joke and needs to be investigated. I have contacted the school\u2019s principal, Dr. Branch, and I trust that he will take this matter seriously and deal with it appropriately.\nIs the principal acting on this?

When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped. When he got back into bed, the agonizing sound hit him again; as if, he told doctors, he had walked through some invisible wall cutting straight down the middle of his room.

Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,\u201d the release said.\nThe Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats with a sonic weapon, and very little additional information is known about those who suffered through the strange ordeal. After months of investigations, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences.

Does Ramadan remind us of \u201cthe richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,\u201d or is Ramadan \u201ca month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers\u201d?\nIslam\u2019s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth. During Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah. Hence it is a time when they\u2019re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims. However, the Qur\u2019an says: \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves\u201d (48:29). If the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout, the Muslim who applies himself diligently to the Ramadan observance will simultaneously become more both merciful to his fellow Muslims and more severe against the unbelievers.\nMurdering infidels thus doesn\u2019t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it. The Kavkaz Center, a website operated by Chechen jihadists, explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad\u2019s time: \u201cThe month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming. The greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) occurred in this blessed month, the month of jihad, zeal and enthusiasm.\u201d\nTrump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that \u201cRamadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,\u201d and was severely misleading the American people. Ironically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone. After all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them. Shadi Hamid of the Qatar-funded Brookings Institution declared: \u201cTrump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist, but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence. Great! Putting all that context aside, it\u2019s offensive and pretty much terrible.\u201d\nWhy? Because Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism. Hamid continued: \u201cWe, as American Muslims, shouldn\u2019t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with. We\u2019re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive.\u201d\nWhat is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst. There is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them.\nMeanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad. And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["A Sister Speaks: \u2018Cor Orans is the Death-Knell of Carmel\u2019\nUnder the first part of my ongoing analysis of \u201cCor orans,\u201d a commenter wrote: \u201cWhen the enemy wants to take a soul, he tries to make it give up prayer.\u201d\nThe Vatican presents a choice: the world, or Christ.\n\u201cThe Prologue [of the Rule of St. Benedict] set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d\nDom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes\nToday I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Religious. They\u2019re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position. These, I might add, are not what we would consider a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d community. They have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language. For obvious reasons I can\u2019t identify them, even to say what country they are in.\nWriting to me in English, by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming, Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery\u2019s council, said, \u201cThe Cor Orans document is the death-knell of Carmel. It signals the end of the contemplative monastic life. Not only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism.\n\u201cThis is a disaster. Especially for Carmel.\u201d\nI contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for \u201cCor orans,\u201d Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later. In fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders.\nThis is the programme:\n\u201cDo not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council.\u201d \u201cIn fact, those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves \u2013 sooner or later, they will die. They will not have sense. They will be outside the church. We need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.\u201d\nAfter breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses \u2013 people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts. Francis and Clare, Sts. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted. \u201cThese contexts have changed. And the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.\u201d\n\u201cWe must not be closed to new things. God is not static,\u201d the cardinal said. \u201cGod is always new movement \u2013 of light, of heat, of demonstration. He speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.\u201d\nThe congregation\u2019s Secretary, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo, is reported as saying, \u201cWith this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.\u201d\nNot the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II. And only, apparently, a single \u201cinterpretation\u201d of it, if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the most virulently anti-Catholic organisation of \u201cCatholic\u201d religious in the world \u2013 and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate.\nCarballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: \u201cA consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church \u2013 inserted in the world. Not in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,\u201d he said.\nIt is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:\n\u201cThe Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d\n\u201cAfter entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it. There shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: \u2018The world is crucified to me and I to the world.\u2019\n\u201cLet us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us. The Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: \u2018No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.\u2019 The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: \u2018Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.\u2019\u201d\nHow Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila\u2019s reform of Carmel\nSister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform. She acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.\nThese are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, \u201congoing formation\u201d courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries. Their funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.\nIn 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr. Saverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers. This suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise. Maccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices. The push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistr\u00e0. Given the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by \u201congoing formation\u201d is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language.\nBut for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa. Authentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, \u201care essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.\u201d\n\u201cThey go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions. Each Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it\u2019s own \u2018feel.\u2019 Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel. Formation in common is something we\u2019ve been fighting against for years.\u201d\n\u201cTo have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away, or take all our finances, or tell the Holy See we\u2019re no longer \u2018viable\u2019 \u2013 this is a disaster. St. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place. And now it\u2019s going to be done to us.\u201d\nShe points to the extended length of formation for new nuns - previously six years for Carmelites and under Cor orans now nine years, as absurd, saying it will tend to impede new vocations.\n\u201cAs though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry. Our Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering. It will also help the monastery become \u2018less viable\u2019 because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.\u201d\nAnother requirement will be for a \u201creligious assistant,\u201d a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation. Sister writes that this was rejected \u201cyears ago\u201d by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference. The religious assistant will have unprecedented powers. Article 23 states, for instance, \u201cIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery. The discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\u201d\n\u201cOne other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights. There are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse. It\u2019s all being done to us. In this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and \u2018choice\u2019 for all, plus the \u2018rights\u2019 of women, here our rights are completely taken away.\u201d\nAnother nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by \u201congoing formation\u201d. Judging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take \u201ccourses\u201d together with novices from other monasteries. The content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of \u201cexperts\u201d chosen by the Federation.\nSister writes, \u201cCloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things. We already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day. I have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of \u2018on-going formation\u2019. Can they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.\u201d\nApparently not.\nAs I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself \u2013 that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do \u2013 starts by laying out its working premise:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\nIn other words, it is the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d of the last few decades of the Church since Vatican II that all monasteries of cloistered, contemplative nuns must now take. Anyone who imagines that this document\u2019s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or \u201cconservative\u201d communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention.\nIn the last 20 years, \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics have pointed to the flourishing \u2013 mainly in the US \u2013 of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d and re-established some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life. They point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates. But it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the New Paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was co-opted, subverted to the new ideology. The little green shoots of hope that the faithful Catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of Vatican II\u2019s perpetual winter.\nIn the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph. Its intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants \u2013 those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 into the full post-conciliar \u201creform\u201d instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s \u2013 or to close them.\nThe thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way. The whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm. I have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009. The numbers are absolutely dismal.\nFederation: Belgium\nnumber of convents: 11 Number of nuns: 120\nsolemnly professed: 119\nin formation: 1 average age: 73\nFederation: Belgium - Luxembourg. number of convents: 11 number of nuns: 122\nsolemnly professed: 117\nin formation: 5\naverage age: 75\nFederation: Germany number of convents: 14 number of nuns: 178\nsolemnly professed: 170\nin formation: 8\naverage age: 66\nThe rest are similar, and I\u2019ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series, but the rest of the responses to the Father General\u2019s questionnaire tell a similar story. The German federation gave a summary of the efforts made to address these issues. \u201cPath taken: For 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators. Meetings for prioresses. Present Problems: Have got very old. Some sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans. Possible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.\u201d\nThis is the death spiral. And it is precisely this \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d taken by nearly all the Catholic world\u2019s monastics since 1965 that Cor orans is attempting to force on the very, very few holdouts.\n", ["Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?\nThe meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] . The reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, \u201creligious assistant\u201d priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations. Given that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.\nToday I\u2019ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the \u201cFederations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land\u201d in Avila, February 2009. As a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely \u201cfederated,\u201d it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what \u201cfederations\u201d are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.\nReconciled to managed extinction\nThe report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, \u201cinfirmary Carmels,\u201d nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation. Solutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by \u201creligious psychologists,\u201d ever more powers handed to federations. This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis\u2019 New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.\nVery little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts. And perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order\u2019s most desperate hour. Nothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites\u2019 traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of \u201cthe path taken\u201d. Indeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.\nThe report from Great Britain notes: \u201c18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years. There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process. Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.\u201d\nThe case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down. Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers. But in this situation, the \u201csolution\u201d undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for \u201ca completely new structure,\u201d whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.\nThe atmosphere is weirdly resigned \u2013 one federation report recommended simply \u201cforgetting the numbers\u201d \u2013 with many notes of mutual congratulation over \u201cunity,\u201d the creating of \u201clinks\u201d and the \u201cbuilding of trust\u201d and \u201cdialogue\u201d between communities. The report from Belgium \u2013 federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries \u2013 states tersely that their biggest problem is \u201cageing\u201d but under \u201cpossible solutions\u201d says only, \u201cWe want to continue along the path we have begun.\u201d\nIt is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2]. It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.\nFederation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation. This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002. But the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: \u201cNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\u201d\nPath taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated. From the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation. Each year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association. The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association. We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.\nPresent Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries. Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\nPossible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.\nThese self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting. All speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared \u201cformation courses,\u201d meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally \u201ccare homes\u201d and houses given over entirely as infirmaries. A tale of controlled, systematized extinction.\n~~~\nFederation: Germany\ndate when erected: 1980\nnumber of convents: 14\nnumber of nuns: 178\nsolemnly professed: 170\nin formation[3]: 8\naverage age: 66\nPath taken: for 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators. Meetings for prioresses.\nPresent problems: have got very old. Some sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans. Different sisters have volunteered to help there.\nPossible solutions: two convents intend to amalgamate.\n~~~\nFederation: Spain \u2013 Castile Burgos\nDate when erected: 1978\nNumber of convents: 20\nNumber of nuns: 245\nSolemnly professed:\nIn formation: 9\nAverage age: between 64\nPath taken: they have worked on communion and systematic formation of the communities. They have established a formation-house for new vocations and held a month long intensive course according to the ratio, given by the same sisters of the federation. In 2004 they established a Carmelite infirmary to help the communities. Courses have been organized to accompany the youngest sisters of the federation, given by a religious psychologist.\nPresent problems: ageing of the sisters and a lack of vocations; we have not arrived at any practical conclusion in the way of amalgamations-restructuring though attempts have been made. The incorporation of sisters from other countries without due discernment in some cases.\nPossible solutions: we are making enquiries.\n~~~\nFederation: Spain - Catalonia\nDate when erected: 1993\nNumber of convents 4\nNumber of nuns: 60\nSolemnly professed:\nIn formation: none\nAverage age: 71\nWhat has been done: there has been one suppression and two convents have amalgamated\nPresent problems: ageing of the sisters and a lack of vocations. We need outside help.\n~~~\nFederation: Spain - Navarre\nDate of erection: 1994\nNumber of convents:16\nNumber of nuns: 229\nSolemnly professed:\nIn formation: 10\nAverage age: 69\nWhat has been done: there has been work on formation: each year, a course on on-going formation and one for those recently professed. There have been 3 suppressions and 3 amalgamations. Work will continue in this area, in order to keep a balance within the communities, based on the present communities and the new vocations.\nPresent Problems: Ageing of the communities, resulting in weakening of life in all its facets. It is not easy to express the reality. A lack of vocations is with us as a reality in everyday life. Moreover, the high number of Carmels makes difficult to maintain all presences.\nPossible Solutions: It is completely necessary to assume the way of the restructurings, in order to live what is essential, forgetting the numbers. The challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead us to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because, to a daughter of Saint Teresa, the really important thing is to look for HIM and to live in obedience. Another of our challenges is caring [for] the ecclesial presences. We think this is the way will lead us to recreate from the interior the Charism of the Mother Teresa.\n~~~\nFederation: France - Toulouse Bordeaux\nDate when erected: 1955\nNumber of convents: 20 + 1 abroad, Athens\nNumber of nuns: 274\nSolemnly professed: 268\nIn formation: 6\nAverage age: 70,6\nWhat has been done: There have been 1 amalgamation & 6 suppressions. The federal priority is the formation. There has been a lot of work in formation: for prioresses, formators & initial. Also with the extern sisters.\nThe infirmary Carmel was closed due to the difficulty of finding a prioress and other personnel. The sisters have gone to other Carmels, except some who have gone to state geriatric homes.\n~~~\nFederation: Italy - Lombardy\nDate when erected: 1996\nNumber of convents: 16\nNumber of nuns: 220\nSolemnly professed: 209\nIn formation: 11\nAverage age: 65\nPresent problems: there are big differences between the various convents.\nThe number of vocations has diminished quickly and the numbers increased of those who have left during formation and during the first years of solemn profession. Nonetheless there have not been amalgamations or suppressions. In some convents old age is a real concern.\nPossible Solutions: They are working on formation through courses. Also on communion between the communities. There are meetings of the Council with the communities. We are ready to accept sisters who cannot be cared for in their own communities. However, this has not been accepted because they do not want to be separated.\nThe strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create \u201ca completely new structure,\u201d complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:\nFederation: Netherlands\nDate when erected: 1971\nNumber of convents: 6\nNumber of nuns: 73\nSolemnly professed: 73\nIn formation: ....\nAverage age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]\nWhat has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation. This has created a close communion from the beginning. Everyone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.\nPresent Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands. 4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception. Another Carmel was renewed in 1990. At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.\nWith the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity. Also, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation. Finally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.\nDue to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible. We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters. The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.\nPossible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.\nWe began from three points:\n1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.\n2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General. The team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.\n3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions. This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.\nIn October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals. They had meetings with Fr. General and with the Congregation for Religious. These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.\nAn important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council. We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.\nIt is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.\nDefinitive permission came at the 25th of February.\n~~~\nGiven this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.\nSr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Religious told them that the \u201ctwo great challenges to our contemplative life\u201d are \u201cthe challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.\u201d She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation. Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:\nThe nuns were exhorted to \u201cstay awake to welcome the dawn\u201d of a bright new future:\n\u201cThese are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.\u201d \u201cOur aim must be to be open to the future. We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps. It is a wide road that opens up before us. We must be women of hope and faith. We must always believe that God is the one who directs history. From this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).\u201d [emphasis in the original.]\nWhile there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.\nInstead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the \u201cproblems and difficulties that we can encounter\u201d in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including \u201cconsumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.\u201d\nWhat are these people smoking?\nGiven that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this \u201cnew dawn\u201d was actually about. Perhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, \u201cA \u2018new dawn\u2019 of what, exactly?\u201d This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church. Was Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?\nIt is certainly clear from Francis\u2019 first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities. His first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation\u2019s Secretary and \u2013 given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them \u2013 the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor. The first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.\nCertainly this record of the European Carmelites\u2019 meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way. On the final day of the meeting, the \u201ctheme for the day\u201d was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: \u201cGovernment: the need for change. Autonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr. General; other solutions to government.\u201d\nThe devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone\u2019s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: \u201cEssential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,\u201d the Father General warned.\nAnd there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works. A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to \u201cask questions\u201d rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:\n\u201cWho discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people? \u201cAre there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations? \u201cAt the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced. Stability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church? \u201cThe valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy. Can such essential autonomy continue as it is? \u201c50 years ago there was stability. How do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr. General?\n\u201cCould there be other forms of government?\u201d\nFollowing the Father General\u2019s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:\n\u201cWhile some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of \u2018external\u2019 interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied. Though we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.\u201d \u201c...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when\u2026 the same person remains prioress for years.\u201d \u201c...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy. We perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures. We do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.\u201d \u201c...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.\u201d\nMaybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the \u201cprogressivist\u201d faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction. What comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican\u2019s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it. And with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.\nSo many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the \u201cconservatives\u201d John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was \u201conside.\u201d At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries. But this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.\n_____________________\n[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.\n\u201cEucharist and Lauds in Spanish. Fr. Isidore D\u2019Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day. Each psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group. However, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages. The end result was that we could all join in the liturgy. We were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.\u201d\n[2] Solution: new foundations, the spreading of the Carmelite charism into new territories.\n[3] This includes all sisters up to final profession, not just postulants and novices.\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["Homeschooling Protects Children from Violence and Marxism\nThe February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida prompted many parents to consider homeschooling. This is hardly surprising, as the misnamed federal \u201cGun-Free Schools\u201d law leaves schoolchildren defenseless against mass shooters. Removing one\u2019s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings.\nSchool shootings are not the only form of violence causing more parents to consider homeschooling. Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students.\nOf course, many parents choose homeschooling as a means of protecting their children from federal education \u201creforms\u201d such as Common Core.

Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education. Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education, concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents\u2019 political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool.\nEven when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government.

Another feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses.\nThe government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty. However, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education.\nWhile government schools \u2014 and even many private schools \u2014 pretend religion played no significant role in history, my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization. However, the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum.\nInteractive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other. The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting.\nConcern about the safety of students in government-run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling, but it is not the only reason. Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core. Other parents do not wish to have their children indoctrinated with views that contradict the parents\u2019 political, social, or even religious beliefs.\nI encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools \u2014alternatives that provide children with a well-rounded education that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty \u2014 to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my homeschooling program.\nArticle posted with permission from Ron Paul\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama\nA former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.\nSpecifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.\nHis lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\n\u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton.

Buchanan: Boehner's Right\u2014It's Trump's Party Now | Articles\nSee, earlier Trump Victorious As GOP Transformed Into A National Conservative Party by James Kirkpatrick, May 3, 2016\n\"There is no Republican Party. There's a Trump party,\" John Boehner told a Mackinac, Michigan, gathering of the GOP faithful last week. \"The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\"\nEx-Speaker Boehner should probably re-check the old party's pulse, for the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping. It could be comatose.\nConsider. That GOP was dedicated to free trade, open borders, amnesty and using U.S. power to punish aggressors and \"end tyranny in our world.\" That GOP set out to create a new world order where dictatorships were threatened with \"regime change,\" and democratic capitalism was the new order of the ages.\nYet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency\u2014by saying goodbye to all that.\nHow probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation?\nBush-Boehner Republicanism appears to be as dead today as was Harding-Coolidge Republicanism after 1933. And if Trumpism is not the future of the GOP, it is hard to see what a promising GOP agenda might look like.\nA brief history: In seven elections starting in 1992, Republicans won the presidency three times, but the popular vote only once, in 2004, when George W. was still basking in his \"Mission Accomplished\" in Iraq.\nWhat fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party?\nFirst, demography. The mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority.\nSecond, the collapse of the Soviet Empire and USSR removed the party's great unifying cause from Eisenhower to Bush I\u2014the Cold War.\nAfter the Red Army went home, \"America First\" had a new appeal!\nThird, faithful to the free trade cult in which they were raised, Republicans championed NAFTA, the WTO, and MFN for China.\nHistorians will look back in amazement at how America's free trade zealots gave away the greatest manufacturing base the world had ever seen, as they quoted approvingly 18th- and 19th-century scribblers whose ideas had done so much to bring down their own country, Great Britain.\nBetween 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense.\nBetween 1992 and 2016, China was allowed to run $4 trillion in trade surpluses at our expense, converting herself into the world's first manufacturing power and denuding America of tens of thousands of factories and millions of manufacturing jobs.\nIn Trump's first year, China's trade surplus with the United States hit $375 billion. From January to March of this year, our trade deficit with China was running at close to the same astronomical rate.\n\"Trade deficits do not matter,\" we hear from the economists.\nThey might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nAnd perhaps someone can explain the wisdom of handing 4 percent of our GDP each year to an adversary nation, as U.S. admirals talk tough about confronting that adversary nation over islets and reefs in the South China Sea.\nWhy are we enriching and empowering so exorbitantly those whom we are told we may have to fight?\nFourth, under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. intervened massively in the Near and Middle East\u2014in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen. And the forces that pushed up into those conflicts, and so disillusioned the nation that it elected Barack Obama, are back, pushing for a new war, on Iran. They may get this war, too.\nYet, given the anti-interventionist and anti-war stance of Trump's winning campaign, and of the Bernie Sanders campaign, U.S. involvement in Middle East wars seems less America's future than it does her past.\nAfter his 16 months in office, it appears as though the Trump presidency, no matter how brief, is going to be a watershed moment in U.S. and world history, and in the future of the GOP.\nThe world is changing. NATO and the EU are showing their age. Nationalism, populism and tribalism are pervasive on the Old Continent. And America's willingness to bear the burden of Europe's defense, as they ride virtually free, is visibly waning.\nIt is hard to see why or how Republicans are ever again going to be the Bush-Boehner party that preceded the rise of Trump.\nWhat would be the argument for returning to a repudiated platform?\nTrump not only defeated 16 Bush Republicans, he presented an agenda on immigration, border security, amnesty, intervention abroad, the Middle East, NAFTA, free trade, Putin and Russia that was a rejection of what the Bush-Boehner Party had stood for and what its presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had run on.\nIf the Republican Party is \"napping,\" let it slumber on, undisturbed, for its time has come and gone.

With Falstaff, Flake appears to believe that \"discretion is the better part of valor.\"\nSen. Bob Corker is another summertime soldier calling on colleagues to stand and fight Trump while he retires to Tennessee.\nIt's no wonder the establishment is viewed with such derision.\nFlake calls Trump \"dangerous to our democracy.\" But the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment's control of the party's agenda and the party's destiny.\nU.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role. Yet, beneath the savagery of the uncivil war in the party lies more than personal insults and personality clashes.\nThis is a struggle about policy, about the future. And Trump is president because he read the party and the country right, while the Bush-McCain Republican establishment had lost touch with both.\nHow could the Beltway GOP not see that its defining policies \u2014 open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention in foreign lands for ideological ends \u2014 were alienating its coalition?\nWhat had a quarter century of Bushite free trade produced?\nAbout $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs.\nWe imported goods \"Made in China,\" while exporting our future.\nU.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia.\nCould Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers' wages had failed to rise for decades?\nWhat did the democracy crusades \"to end tyranny in our world\" accomplish?\nThousands of U.S. dead, tens of thousands of wounded, trillions of dollars sunk, and a Mideast awash in blood from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen, with millions uprooted and homeless. Yet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this.\nWith the Cold War over for a quarter of a century, what is the case now for America, $20 trillion in debt, going abroad in search of monsters to destroy?\nConsider. Bush-Obama \"open borders\" brought in tens of millions of Third World peoples, legally and illegally, to rising resistance from Americans forced to bear the economic and social costs.\nWhat was the GOP establishment's reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here?\nTo call them nativists and parade their moral superiority.\nFlake and Corker are being beatified by the Beltway elites, and George W. Bush and John McCain celebrated for their denunciations of Trumpism.\nYet no two people are more responsible for the blunders of the post-Cold War era than McCain and Bush.\nAbout which of half a dozen wars were they right?\nYesterday's New York Times recognized Trump's triumph:\n\"Despite the fervor of President Trump's Republican opponents, the president's brand of hard-edged nationalism\u2014with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration\u2014is taking root within his adopted party.\"\nMoreover, a new question arises:\nCan the GOP establishment believe that if Trump falls, or they bring him down, they will inherit the estate and be welcomed home like the Prodigal Son? Do they believe their old agenda of open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism and democracy-crusading can become America's agenda again?\nTrumpism is not a detour, after which we can all get back on the interstate to the New World Order.\nFor though unpleasant, it is not unfair to say that if there was one desire common to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump voters, it was be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us.\nShould Trump fall, and a restored establishment attempt to reimpose the old policies, there will be a truly uncivil war in this country.\nAfter the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back. As that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe, put it, \"You can't go home again.\"\nTraditionalists have been told that for years. Now it's the turn of the GOP establishment to learn the truth as well.\nGoldwater lost badly, but the establishment that abandoned him never had its patrimony restored.

American Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE! | Articles\n)\nForget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump\u2019s latest DACA dalliance \u2014the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work. December marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year. Simultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September. And, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.\nWhat started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat. This is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway.\nAccording to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016\u2014a decline of 0.18%. This follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.\nNot since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months\u2014but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding. This makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking.\nNote that this is a net figure. The year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in. About 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies. [U.S. Immigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period\u2014the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.\nThis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).\nThe additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers\u2019 immigrant status (but not their legal status). The Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month\u2014well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.\nIn December 2017:\nImmigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%\nNative-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 \u2013 up 0.27%\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9.\nThe native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..\nThe New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9/106.0))\nTrump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years.

It fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election, but roared back to Obama-era levels in the spring. Immigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November\u2019s 17.16% share.\nCan't render, error\nA detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.\nOver the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017):\nThe native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.

It now seems obvious that one of those mysterious memos has gone out to the Main Stream Media saying that no-one can mention the immigration moratorium solution. But unemployment is befuddling anyway.\nJust a few weeks ago professional prognosticators were expecting job growth of 175,000 in May. However, nonfarm payroll growth came in at 54,000 in May, the smallest gain since September, and a fraction of the just lowered consensus forecast (125,000 jobs.)\nThe \"other\" employment survey, of households rather than businesses, also broadcast mixed signals\u2014at least so far as the prospects for native-born workers are concerned. VDARE.com has long argued that the household survey captures the employment of illegal aliens; additionally, it actually mentions ethnicity.\nIn May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000. Non-Hispanics actually gained ground:\nTotal employment: up 105,000 (+0.08 percent)\nNon-Hispanic employment: up 190,000 (+0.16 percent)\nHispanic employment: down 85,000 (-0.42 percent)\nThus VDAWDI\u2014VDARE.com's American Worker Displacement Index, unveiled in 2004 and still unique\u2014fell to 126.2 in May from April's 127.0 level.\nThis, of course, is atypical statistical noise. Non-Hispanics have lost jobs at twice the rate of Hispanics since the recession hit in December 2007. And since the official start of the \"recovery\" in June 2009, Hispanics have gained 416,000 jobs while non-Hispanics have lost 675,000 positions.\nStep back further and the picture is still bleaker. Since January 2001 the number of non-Hispanics holding jobs has declined by 1.9 million, or by -1.6%. Over that same period Hispanic employment rose by 3.9 million, up a whopping 24.2%.\nSimply put, the 21st century has not been good for non-Hispanic job seekers.\nThis Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was, of course, a convenient proxy for VDARE.com's primary interest: foreign-born workers and their role in displacing their native-born counterparts. We tracked this by looking at Hispanics because such a high proportion of them are foreign-born\u2014and because the federal government declined to provide data on immigrant vs. non-immigrant unemployment.\nHowever, since January 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] has begun to publish figures for foreign-born and native-born employment. These data are not seasonally adjusted, making month to month trends difficult to interpret.

Native-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years. And, shown above, this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election.\nWhile May was a welcome respite, Trump supporters have reason to complain: Since taking office in January 2017 President Trump has presided over a labor market in which immigrants have gained 1.006 million jobs, a 3.9% increase, while native-born Americans gained about 2.4 million jobs \u2014a rise of only 1.9%. As far as the labor market is concerned, \u201cAmerica First\u201d has not translated to Americans First.\nIn normal times, this might be a big story. But the even the conservative non-Main Stream Media is currently too steeped in economic euphoria to notice. Nd anyway, they almost never report the immigration dimension.\nHowever, it is now absolutely clear that immigration, and immigrant displacement of American workers, cannot be jawboned away. The only answer is legislation\u2014 border wall to stop the illegal alien flow; a second Operation Wetback, including E-Verify, to get the illegal alien self-deporting; a moratorium on legal immigration.\nMay 2018 was the fifth consecutive month in which the foreign-born working age population (including illegals) grew by more than 1 million from the same month the prior year. But May\u2019s growth was less than that in April and March, possibly an emerging trend.\nCan't render, error\nIn May 2018 there were 1.342 million more working-age immigrants than in May 2017. This comes on the heels of gains of 2.154 million and 1.597 million. year-over-year, in March and April, respectively.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe with the evaporation of the Trump Effect, but less than six months ago we were seeing to year-over-year declines in the immigrant workforce population. The last five months of 2017 saw the foreign-born population fall by an average 100,000 from the same month of the prior year (shown in red on our chart).\nThese are net figures. Over a 12-month period an average of perhaps 300,000 immigrants die and an equal number leave the U.S. voluntarily. So the 1.342 million net rise in foreign-born population, May 2017 to May 2018, implies that nearly 2 million foreign-born individuals may have actually settled in the country over those 12 months. (This excludes tourists and other short-term entrants.)\nIn percentage terms, the immigrant working-age population grew 3.24% over the 12 months. If this growth rate persists, it portends a doubling in 22 years. By contrast, the native-born American population rose 0.63% over this period \u2014a rate that will require 114 years for a doubling. If both rates persist that long, the term \u201cnative born\u201d will refer to a minuscule fraction of the U.S. population.\nAnother way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment:\nCan't render, error\nImmigrants accounted for 17.36% of total employment in May.

The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal.\nThe head of Iran\u2019s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges. He made the comment a day after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.\nThe Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama\u2019s team was willing to go to ensure the deal\u2019s success as it was still being negotiated.\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.\n\u201cSenior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,\u201d according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times. \u201cDespite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.\n\u201cEven after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,\u201d the report said.\nSen. Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel\u2019s findings Wednesday.\nUnder terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained \u201cillegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.\u201d\nThe ban included any \u201cintermediary\u201d transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran \u2014 a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.\nOn the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.\nOn Tehran\u2019s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s office of foreign assets control.\nAccording to the Senate report: \u201cMuscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros. [But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.\u201d\nObama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would \u201ccontinue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market\u201d under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.\n\u201cOn February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,\u201d according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made \u201ceven though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.\u201d\nEven as office of foreign assets control officials directly \u201cencouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,\u201d the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama \u201cadministration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.\u201d\nThe catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange \u2014 in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.\nMr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that \u201cthe Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran.\u201d\n\u201cDespite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,\u201d Mr. Portman said. \u201cThe only reason this transaction wasn\u2019t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.\u201d\nSuch sanctions, he added, \u201care a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.\u201d\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Spygate Coverup?\nhttps://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/spygate-coverup/\nRep.

Isn\u2019t he prejudging the case without even finding out what actually happened? If Ryan is correct, an investigation will show it; but the current evidence suggests he is wrong. By short-circuiting the investigation, Ryan is betraying the interest of the American people to learn what the FBI and CIA actually did against Trump.

They don\u2019t want the rotten inner workings of the organization to be aired publicly. They want to preserve the FBI\u2019s reputation. They don\u2019t care to see Trump vindicated.

The question is how many more are there? And that's part of why Spygate is happening. The assault is also a cover-up.\nThe report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars. If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system. The effort was unsuccessful because American banks \u2014 themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions \u2014 declined to participate. The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran.\nThat's how bad Obama was on Iran. The banking system was more reluctant to help Iran launder money than he was.\nNor was Obama worried about the reputational risk of loading foreign currency on unmarked cargo planes and flying it to Iran.\nIssuing the license was not illegal. Still, it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement.\nExcept Obama Inc. weren't trying to drive a hard bargain. So they didn't stick to it. They were trying to aid Iran.\nShortly after the nuclear deal was sealed in July 2015, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew testified that even with the sanctions relief, Iran \u201cwill continue to be denied access to the world\u2019s largest financial and commercial market.\u201d A month later, one of Lew\u2019s top deputies, Adam Szubin, testified that despite the nuclear deal \u201cIran will be denied access to the world\u2019s most important market and unable to deal in the world\u2019s most important currency.\u201d\nThis was typical of the worthless assurances that Obama officials made. And disgraced themselves by doing so.\nObama administration officials at the time assured concerned lawmakers that a general license wouldn\u2019t be coming. But the report from the Republican members of the Senate panel showed that a draft of the license was indeed prepared, though it was never published. And when questioned by lawmakers about the possibility of granting Iran any kind of access to the U.S. financial system, Obama-era officials never volunteered that the specific license for Bank Muscat in Oman had been issued two months earlier.\nScandal-free administration, folks.

Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother\u2019s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Florida.\nThe finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.\nIn February 2017, Kiko and the House\u2019s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network. The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.\nBut Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on \u201cwebsites\u201d and \u201cprinters,\u201d which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.\nThe congresswoman also added Awan\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network. Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 \u2014 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.\nHer actions so rattled the Administration Committee\u2019s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said. The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a \u201cfriendly personal relationship\u201d with Awan and Alvi.\nFleet did not respond to a request for comment.\nKiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor.\n\u201cTermination, now it\u2019s the member\u2019s responsibility \u2026 We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,\u201d he said. He added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.\nWasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said. House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.\nYet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, \u201cmy office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.\nDespite Wasserman Schultz\u2019s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 \u2014 two months after he was banned from the computer network \u2014 the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk. Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan\u2019s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said \u201cattorney client privilege,\u201d according to a police report. Awan\u2019s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.\nThat led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with \u201cconsequences\u201d for not returning the laptop. When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police\u2019s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.\nHouse sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole.

U.S. Code 2381 says: \u201cWhoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\u201d\nIn a sane political environment, Barack Obama would be tried for treason.\nBarack Hussein Obama has planted seeds that will be bearing bitter fruit for years, and probably decades, to come. He is, without any doubt, the worst President in American history. Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan? Yes, the doughface Presidents made the Civil War inevitable, but worse came later. Grant? Blind to corruption and out of his depth, but there have been worse than he as well. Wilson? That black-hearted Presbyterian bigot arguably gave the world Hitler and World War II, so he is definitely in the Final Four. Harding? Nah: his tax cuts and return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d got the American economy, and the Twenties, roaring. FDR and LBJ gave us the modern welfare state and dependent classes automatically voting Democrat; the full bill on the damage they did hasn\u2019t yet been presented. Nixon? A crook and an economic Leftist, who betrayed Taiwan for the People\u2019s Republic; his record certainly isn\u2019t good. Carter? Nothing good can be said about his four years of sanctimony and incompetence.\nBut there is one thing Barack Obama has on all competitors: treason.\nHe showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran. There are those who say, \u201cIt was their money. It belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979.\u201d Indeed, and there was a reason for that: not even Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah\u2019s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah. Likewise Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah.\nOnly Barack Obama did.\nThe definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel. How was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason?\nOther Presidents have been incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama?\nThe Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations, one of which, Hizballah, is quite active in Mexico now, with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans. Obama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives, as well as to Iran\u2019s nuclear program, with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons, in exchange for absolutely nothing.\nThere is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama\u2019s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt. But they likely will be felt in one way or another. Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause.\nHowever this catastrophe plays out, there is one man who will suffer no consequences whatsoever: Barack Obama.

The indoctrination is getting so bad, that some parents are even concerned about liberal violence against those who reject the brainwashing.\nAccording to The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Florida, was the last straw for scores of parents. The paper noted that \u201cthe phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,\u201d said coalition president Tim Lambert. \u201cIn the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled. We\u2019re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.\u201d But according to Natural News, it isn\u2019t just the rampant violence worrying some parents. That\u2019s just the tip of the collectivist agenda iceberg.\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with \u201cthe violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.\u201d Many parents are also disturbed by the social engineering, which amounts to brainwashing and indoctrination that goes on in a public school. For example, a Minnesota public school is forcing Kindergarten students to study \u2018white privilege\u2019.\nThe left-wing curriculum and common core are also driving parents to remove their children from public schools. Brian D. Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who\u2019s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents. Ray said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nSince teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem. \u201cMost parents homeschool for more than one reason,\u201d Ray told the paper. \u201cBut when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity. It includes all of that.\u201d\nIndoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically. It\u2019s the very reason the governments of the world still exist. People cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong \u2013 even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it. Governments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others. But humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.\n\ufeff\nIt isn\u2019t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.

Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an international affairs assistant in the Iran\u2019s judiciary, disclosed in Farsi-language remarks broadcast on Iran\u2019s state-controlled television that Iranian intelligence officials secretly helped provide the al Qaeda attackers with passage and gave them refuge in the Islamic Republic, according to an English translation published by Al Arabiya. \u201cOur government agreed not to stamp the passports of some of them because they were on transit flights for two hours, and they were resuming their flights without having their passports stamped. However their movements were under the complete supervision of the Iranian intelligence,\u201d Larijani was quoted as saying. The remarks represent the first time senior Iranian officials have publicly admitted to aiding al Qaeda and playing a direct role in facilitating the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. government has long accused Iran of playing a role in the attacks and even fined the Islamic Republic billions as a result. The U.S. 9/11 Commission assembled to investigate the attacks concluded that Iran played a role in facilitating the al Qaeda terrorists. Larijani admitted that Iranian officials did not stamp the passports of the al Qaeda militants in order to obfuscate their movements and prevent detection by foreign governments.

This is a seriously important issue. The people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information. They are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi.\nBut who guards the guardians?\nFor if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask. One could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and the \u201cmanosphere\u201d; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations. (Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)\nAnd the label of \u201cviolent extremist\u201d turns out to be used very generously. Ganesh makes wild leaps and inferences. He talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque. This was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned. But why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh? The attack \u201cwas executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it. He found a narrative from British counter-jihad groups closely aligned with the alt-right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.\u201d The British counter-jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh \u201cknows\u201d they encouraged him.\nThe BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs. Ganesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne\u2019s mind. Rather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne\u2019s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson. Yet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence. What \u201cnarrative from British counter-jihad groups\u201d can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque? I\u2019m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it. But there is none offered \u2013 only surmise and Ganesh\u2019s mindreading techniques. I suppose if you\u2019re paid to fight online extremism, you\u2019d better find it, or you\u2019re out of a job and short of academic publication.\nWe have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is \u201calt-right.\u201d He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist \u2013 he\u2019s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn\u2019t like the infiltration by the far right. He shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.\nThe writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online.\nWe have to ask. Is it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a \u201cresearcher\u201d who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson\u2019s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?\nThere\u2019s more.

They have not won, not yet, and they have not destroyed the man. Only the silence of good people will allow them to win. Julian Assange has never been more isolated.

Glenn Greenwald Best Price: $1.49 Buy New $3.70 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details)\nDennis Bernstein: We continue our discussion of the case of Julian Assange, now in the Ecuadorian embassy in Great Britain. John Pilger, it is great to talk to you again. But it is a profound tragedy, John, the way they are treating Julian Assange, this prolific journalist and publisher who so many other journalists have depended on in the past. He has been totally left out in the cold to fend for himself.\nJohn Pilger: I have never known anything like it. There is a kind of eerie silence around the Julian Assange case. Julian has been vindicated in every possible way and yet he is isolated as few people are these days. He is cut off from the very tools of his trade, visitors aren\u2019t allowed. I was in London recently and I couldn\u2019t see him, although I spoke to people who had seen him. Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador, said recently that he regarded what they are doing to Julian now as torture. It was Correa\u2019s government that gave Julian political refuge, which has been betrayed now by his successor, the government led by Lenin Moreno, which is back to sucking up to the United States in the time-honored way, with Julian as the pawn and victim.\nShould be a \u2018Constitutional Hero\u2019\nBut really it comes down to the British government. Although he is still in a foreign embassy and actually has Ecuadorian nationality, his right of passage out of that embassy should be guaranteed by the British government. The United Nations Working Party on Unlawful Detentions has made that clear. Britain took part in an investigation which determined that Julian was a political refugee and that a great miscarriage of justice had been imposed on him. It is very good that you are doing this, Dennis, because even in the media outside the mainstream, there is this silence about Julian. The streets outside the embassy are virtually empty, whereas they should be full of people saying that we are with you. The principles involved in this case are absolutely clear-cut. Number one is justice. The injustice done to this man is legion, both in terms of the bogus Swedish case and now the fact that he must remain in the embassy and can\u2019t leave without being arrested, extradited to the United States and ending up in a hell hole. But it is also about freedom of speech, about our right to know, which is enshrined in the United States Constitution. If the Constitution were taken literally, Julian would be a constitutional hero, actually. Instead, I understand the indictment they are trying to concoct reads like a charge of espionage! It\u2019s so ridiculous.That is the situation as I see it, Dennis. It is not a happy one but it is one that people should rally to quickly.\nDB: His journalistic brethren are sounding like his prosecutors. They want to get behind Russia-gate freaks like Congressman Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo, who would like to see Assange in jail forever or even executed. How do you respond to journalists acting like prosecutors, some of whom used his material to do stories? This is a terrible time for journalism.\nJP: You are absolutely right: It is a terrible time for journalism. I have never known anything quite like it in my career. That said, it is not new. There has always been a so-called mainstream which really comes down to great power in media. It has always existed, particularly in the United States. The Pulitzer Prize this year was awarded to The New York Times and The Washington Post for witch-hunting around Russia-gate! They were praised for \u201chow deeply sourced their investigations were.\u201d Their investigations turned up not a shred of real evidence to suggest any serious Russian intervention in the 2016 election.\nLike Webb\nThe Julian Assange case reminds me of the Gary Webb case. Bob Parry was one of Gary Webb\u2019s few supporters in the media. Webb\u2019s \u201cDark Alliance\u201d series contained evidence that cocaine trafficking was going on with the connivance of the CIA. Later Webb was hounded by fellow journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide. The CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him. Now, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life. His resilience is remarkable. But he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering.\nProbably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations\u2014like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks \u201cWar Logs\u201d and \u201cCablegate,\u201d The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian. The Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden. But their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong. It was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.\nProfessionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career. The persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks. One of Assange\u2019s great tormentors, The Guardian\u2018s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source. I suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this. My understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed. They realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.\nDB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange. Any serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated. And yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders\u2026this is not a part of the story!\nEight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia\nJP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story. And now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks! There\u2019s a kind of farcical element to this. I mean, none of this came from the Russians. That WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous. WikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government. If you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia.\nDB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack. He went to the White House Press Roast and, after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff, he yelled out \u201cWhat about Julian Assange?\u201d The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out. It was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized.\nJP: Randy shouted some truth. It is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern. Ray is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled. I might suggest he is a renegade now.\nDB: It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting \u201cStop resisting, stop resisting!\u201d and they are beating the hell out of him!\nJP: I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling. These four overweight, obviously ill-trained young men manhandling Ray, who is 78 years old. There was something highly emblematic about that for me. He stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture. It is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well. But real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth. There is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments. It is almost as if the word \u201cjournalism\u201d is becoming blighted.\nDB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel. Then the word \u201ccollusion\u201d is quite appropriate.\nJP:That\u2019s the ultimate collusion. But that\u2019s collusion with silence. Never has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel. It suggests another word and that is \u201cimmunity.\u201d It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity. We see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Israel has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return. In the media these were described as \u201cclashes.\u201d Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people. A rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted. All the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.\nDB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism? Where does he come into the picture?\nJP:I think it comes down to information. If you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret. The right to know what governments are doing in our name\u2014on our behalf or to our detriment\u2014is our moral right. Julian feels very passionately about this. There were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation. There were times when I said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?\u201d Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was \u201cno.\u201d The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service. I was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region. This was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup. It detailed how subversion should work. Of course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on. I was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela. It also reminds us that so-called \u201cmeddling\u201d by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense. The word \u201cmeddling\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of action implied in this document. It is intervention in another country\u2019s affairs.\nWikiLeaks has done that all over the world. It has given people the information they have a right to have. They had a right to find out from the so-called \u201cWar Logs\u201d the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They had a right to find out about Cablegate. That\u2019s when, on Clinton\u2019s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers. You can see why Julian made enemies. But he should also have made a huge number of friends. This is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise. I think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression \u201cright to know.\u201d This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening. The enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.\nDB: And who can forget the release of the \u201ccollateral murder\u201d footage by Chelsea Manning?\nJP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.

They want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?

With Islamization. With open borders. We are almost foreigners in our own lands. And if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes. But I say, no more! And what do you say? No more! And that\u2019s right: enough is enough. We will not be gagged anymore. No more tyranny.\u201d\nIt was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all. Several years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever \u2013 at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration.\nEven worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern. Pamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad. Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation. Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.\nThe UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest. Second \u2013 burn them to death. Third \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff. Fourth \u2013 tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth \u2013 a combination of the above.\u201d\nTheresa May\u2019s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws. One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.\nBut now matters are coming to a head. Apparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again. And so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny.\nTommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs. Clearly the government\u2019s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators. Theresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence.\nThe British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable. That heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now. British public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state.\nWilders addressed this endeavor head-on, declaring: \u201cWe will not be silenced. We will not be intimidated. And we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you. We will never surrender. We will stand strong and do our duty. We will defend our civilization. And we will protect our people.\u201d\nWilders added: \u201cAnd I tell you, to the governments. You can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us. Because, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up. So take notice, Theresa May. Take notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte. Take notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron. Take notice: the future is ours and not yours. We will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.\u201d\nIf Wilders\u2019 words don\u2019t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand.\n[Photo by Jan Kranendonk]\n", ["Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Straw_Man", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["#FreeTommy Robinson Rally Draws Tens Of Thousands\nThis weekend, the #FreeTommy Robinson rally drew upwards of 20,000 supporters, according to organizers, in support of the outspoken critic of Islam and exposer of their crimes in his country and against his tyrannical arrest and imprisonment.\nAmong those in attendance at the Saturday rally in London outside Downing Street were UKIP leader Gerard Batten, For Britain leader Anne Marie Waters, former Breitbart London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam and Dutch opposition leader Geert Wilders.\nWilders, who had been banned from entering the UK, tweeted out his support of Tommy Robinson prior to speaking to those in attendance.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

The paper noted that \u201cthe phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet.\u201d\nThe Times added:The Lubbock-based organization has been swamped with inquiries for months from parents seeking safer options for their kids in the aftermath of this year\u2019s deadly school massacres, first in Parkland and then in Santa Fe, Texas.\n\u201cWhen the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,\u201d said coalition president Tim Lambert. \u201cIn the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.

Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama. Such mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols. The report from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Mr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts. Special FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, an attorney who has since left the FBI, were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti-Trump text messages. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton.\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s report focused on process and procedures. The inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that \u201chis review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions.\" Moreover, this report did not address whether the Department of Justice or FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance order against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, or the government\u2019s reliance on former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele\u2019s salacious and unverified \u201cdossier\u201d in its FISA court application, which the OIG is investigating separately.\nIn analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report\u2019s conclusions, it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version, which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release, emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form. To be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting \u201cthe perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.\u201d Comey, according to the OIG report, \u201cengaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.\u201d\nStarting with Comey\u2019s public announcement on July 5, 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d but also announcing that the FBI was \u201cexpressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,\u201d Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general. He \u201cupset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,\u201d the report said.\nComey\u2019s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized. The first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin. This letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey\u2019s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate. Comey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did. The OIG report was highly critical of the FBI\u2019s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election.\nThe criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation. Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general\u2019s criticisms of Comey\u2019s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump\u2019s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons. However, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card.\nThe fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo. Comey\u2019s initial draft statement, which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2, criticized Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d but concluded that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation. Indeed, Comey admitted in his book that \u201cwe started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.\u201d\nIf putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough, Comey\u2019s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months, including, most importantly, changing the description of Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information from \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d to \u201cextremely careless.\u201d This change was critical because \u201cgross negligence\u201d is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 793(f) for a finding of criminal conduct. Comey\u2019s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase, \u201cextremely careless,\u201d for the \u201cgross negligence\u201d statutory legal standard he had originally used, had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor. Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits.\nInspector General Horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase \u201cgross negligence\u201d from Comey\u2019s statement. Mr. Horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge Clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving e-mails determined to contain classified information. Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report thus concluded, \u201cWe did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.\u201d This conclusion defies common sense. Gross negligence is not the same as willful intent, which Comey and his team sought to conflate in exonerating Hillary Clinton before the investigation was concluded. Clinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information. It turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties. Hillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact. As Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton. Coupled with her agents\u2019 destruction of thousands of e-mails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, Hillary\u2019s conduct was criminally reckless at the very least, if not constituting willful intent to commit an act she knew was wrongful. Yet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.\nThe failure to at least empanel a grand jury to compel testimony from Hillary Clinton and key witnesses was itself a complete dereliction of duty, which could have only been motivated by a desire to treat Hillary Clinton with kid gloves for improper reasons. Incredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report \u201cfound no persuasive evidence\u2026 that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.\u201d\nMr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey\u2019s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral. Comey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was. Mr. Horowitz simply took Comey\u2019s word for what he had meant.\nInspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a \u201ctroubling lack of any direct, substantive communication\u201d between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey\u2019s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress. Attorney General Lynch\u2019s infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton was discussed in the report, but mostly in the context of how it affected Comey\u2019s decision to go rogue, so to speak, in making his July 5th announcement without prior approval from the Justice Department. As to the substance of Ms. Lynch\u2019s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife\u2019s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report had to say was that it was \u201can error in judgment.\u201d\nThe OIG report also criticized the conduct of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who had exchanged text messages sharply critical of Mr. Trump before and after the election, for casting \u201ca cloud over the entire FBI investigation.\u201d The report referenced a text message on August 8, 2016, in which Strzok reassured Page that she need not worry about Donald Trump becoming president. Trump is \u201cnot ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d Page texted Strzok. \u201cNo. No he\u2019s not. We\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded. Mr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was \u201cnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d The inspector general questioned whether Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias. Ultimately, however, he inexplicably concluded that there was no finding of \u201cdocumentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions\u201d discussed in the OIG report.\nStrzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States. The punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both. Instead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.\nIn sum, the long-awaited inspector general report on the FBI\u2019s and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation is as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the e-mail investigation itself.\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch\u2026 Plus A Whole Lot More!\nInspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019 report on the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former FBI Director James Comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the Clinton investigation, it stops short of blaming it all on politics.\nHorowitz\u2019 report not only slams Comey, but it also criticizes former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and immoral FBI philanderers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\nHorowitz blames Comey, Strzok, and Page for besmirching the good name of the FBI and harming the agencies reputation with the American people.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

However, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI\u2019s Obama era leadership.\nWhile the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI\u2019s political leanings in his Russia report.\nThe Washington Post explains:\nThe Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president\u2026 Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to hurt Trump\u2019s chances to become president. Perhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from making it to the White House. \u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.\n\u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded\u2026\nThe inspector general concluded that Strzok\u2019s text, along with others disparaging Trump, \u201cis not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d\nThe messages \u201cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u201d the inspector general wrote\u2026\nStrzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn\u2019t win, and that he wasn\u2019t implying that they would take action to stop his election. But it wasn\u2019t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump\u2026 DURING the investigation.\nPage and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton. The report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought \u201cdiscredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI\u2019s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.\u201d The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe. \u201cThe messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,\u201d Horowitz alleged. \u201cUltimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.\u201d\nThe IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense.\nThe report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton\u2019s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case. By no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned \u201cvirtually every fact\u201d it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner\u2019s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin. The inspector general derided the bureau\u2019s reasons for not moving more quickly \u2014 that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn\u2019t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case \u2014 as \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d \u201cillogical,\u201d and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton. The report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead. \u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d the report said.\nDid you get that? IG Horowitz can\u2019t prove it, but he\u2019s not sure that Strzok wasn\u2019t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.\nHow in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance? We see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases? There were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!\nNot only that, the team that handled Clinton\u2019s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation! Meaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.\nThis is INSANE.\nMeanwhile, another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess. Not only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.\nIn a newly released FBI email, we learned that \u201cforeign actors\u201d gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsecure email system.\nFox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week\u2019s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday. The House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton\u2019s email security. \u201cDocuments provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 including at least one email classified \u2018Secret,'\u201d the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.\nHere\u2019s the email in question:\nPeter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd\nThe email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it\u2019s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d in the handling of classified intel. Remember, Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey\u2019s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d to the legally superflous \u201cextremely careless.\u201d\nAt HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:\nIn the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton. Strzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when \u201cPetraeus/Berger/Libby\u201d did not. He writes, \u201cWe draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e. notwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.\u201d In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn\u2019t intentionally give anything away. Of course, the statute itself didn\u2019t make intent a prerequisite. Herridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: \u201cOfficials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite \u2018intent\u2019 for charges to be filed,\u201d the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required \u2014 which the memo says ignored \u201cmeaningful aspects\u201d of the law. It really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.\nI fully believe IG Horowitz\u2019 findings here. I believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email case, and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled, it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably. However, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he\u2019s concluded his Russia investigation. In fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report. Much of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok\u2019s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess. It\u2019s quite possible that as bad as this report is for Comey, Strzok, Page, and Obama\u2019s FBI leadership\u2026 Horowitz\u2019 conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse.\nWe\u2019ll see.\nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Foolish Religion Author Gary Wills: \u2018The Religion of the Qur\u2019an Is a Religion of Peace\u2019\nOutside of specialists and seekers, the only reason why there is general interest in the Qur\u2019an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism. With What the Qur\u2019an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:\nWhat did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels? Some people are sure it is there, though it isn\u2019t. Then what does it say about Shari\u2019ah law? Not a thing (p. 7).\nThat would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness. Unfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments \u201cRobert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur\u2019an\u201d (p. 58). I have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book. Wills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim. His manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur\u2019an.\nWills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur\u2019an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur\u2019anic incitement and hatred. For example, he quotes 5:51 -- \u201cYou who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies\u201d (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths\u201d (p. 124). Wills never mentions Qur\u2019an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia.\nWills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur\u2019an. He renders one key passage in this way: \u201cFight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God\u201d (2:193; p. 133). Whence the bracketed interpolation \u201cat the shrine\u201d? Wills doesn\u2019t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself. By adding \u201cat the shrine\u201d to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca. He ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.\nThe prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:\nThe worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator. To eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.\nWills doesn\u2019t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them. Likewise, when he claims that the Qur\u2019an has \u201cnot a thing\u201d to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur\u2019an is one of the sources of Sharia.\nThe Qur\u2019an\u2019s declarations that a woman\u2019s testimony is worth half that of a man\u2019s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who \u201cwage war against Allah and his messenger\u201d are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions. Because these stipulations are found in the Qur\u2019an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.\nThroughout his book, Wills\u2019 assurances that the Qur\u2019an is not really as bad as \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny. Again and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.\nHe asks why the Qur\u2019an is \u201cso ferocious to \u2018hypocrites\u2019 and apostates\u201d (p. 124). Then he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that \u201cif we sin again on purpose\u201d there is \u201conly a terrifying judgment to come\u201d (p. 126). Wills concludes: \u201cThe Qur\u2019an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness\u201d (p. 126).\nThat sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur\u2019an is more merciful than the New Testament. Until one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur\u2019an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur\u2019anic passage on this topic:\ntake our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

The Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur\u2019an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book\u2019s core tenets. ISIS quoted the Qur\u2019an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur\u2019an-based tax, cf. Qur\u2019an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.\nISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur\u2019an memorization contests. One of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur\u2019an. Children in the Islamic State study the Qur\u2019an and get weapons training. One Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur\u2019an led him to join the Islamic State. A Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur\u2019an. An Islamic State propagandist\u2019s parents said of him: \u201cOur son is a devout Muslim. He had learnt the Quran by heart.\u201d A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cdoctrine stems from the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah.\u201d\nHow would Garry Wills explain all that? He can\u2019t; he has just explained all Qur\u2019anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur\u2019an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum.\nWills\u2019 na\u00efve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur\u2019an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis. Francis has proclaimedpreposterously that \u201cauthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.\u201d Wills\u2019 book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church\u2019s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur\u2019an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.\nIt isn\u2019t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["After Calling for Guns & Ammo Confiscation & Universal Gun Registration, the American Medical Association Should Think About Taking \"American\" Out of Their Name\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) should seriously consider changing their names since they are about as anti-American as it comes in their new demands for gun confiscation measures, which include guns and ammunition confiscation, as well as universal gun registration.\nThe AMA, which should take no political position when it comes to guns, except to uphold the law which protects the God-given rights of law-abiding citizens, came out with a lengthy blog post not only calling for guns and ammunition confiscation, as well as universal gun registration but also proposals to ban the sale and possession of \u201call assault-type weapons, bump stocks and related devices, high-capacity magazines, and armor piercing bullets.\u201d\nNow, the majority of people at the AMA probably couldn't tell you any of these devices or items if they saw them, but they are advancing an agenda.

Wrong.\nYeah, that's gonna keep people safe. It's going to infringe on the rights of those who don't commit crimes and need a gun to protect themselves or be part of the constitutional militia.\nThe AMA also wants to bypass the Fifth Amendment protections concerning someone actually being indicted and found guilty of a crime being deprived of their liberty and property as they promote a new legal procedure by which \u201cfamily members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel\u201d can petition courts to confiscate firearms from people \u201cwhen there is a high or imminent risk for violence.\u201d\nThey want to do what President Donald Trump suggested and \"take the guns first\" and forget due process.\nSee?

While he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a \u201cbattle\u201d with the \u201centire religion\u201d of Islam, he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non-Muslim world.\nI document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS . To take one of innumerable examples, Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a fifteenth-century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane, observed that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion. Muhammad advises the same thing, according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors: wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels, as much to acquire that glory, as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests.\u201d\nAfter conquest came dhimmitude, the subjugated status that the Qur\u2019an mandates for \u201cthe People of the Book\u201d (primarily Jews and Christians). In the early twelfth century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkamillah issued this edict:\nNow, the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come\u2014where it is their lot\u2014is considered an act of piety; and the imposition of their poll tax [jizya], \u201cuntil they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled\u201d (Koran 9:29) is a divinely ordained obligation\u2026.The dhimmi\u2019s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim, or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated. It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him, so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low. The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full, without exception.\nUnderlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non-Muslims. In the year 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces:\nO you who believe! The non-Muslims are nothing but dirt. Allah has created them to be partisans of Satan; most treacherous in regard to all they do; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless, though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work. Upon them rests the curse of Allah, of the Angels and of man collectively\nWe must not think that we are at war with the entire religion. But what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us?\nNigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Whataboutism", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Julian Assange\nThe persecution of Julian Assange must end. Or it will end in tragedy.\nThe Australian government and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have an historic opportunity to decide which it will be.\nThey can remain silent, for which history will be unforgiving. Or they can act in the interests of justice and humanity and bring this remarkable Australian citizen home.\nAssange does not ask for special treatment. The government has clear diplomatic and moral obligations to protect Australian citizens abroad from gross injustice: in Julian\u2019s case, from a gross miscarriage of justice and the extreme danger that await him should he walk out of the Ecuadorean embassy in London unprotected.\nWe know from the Chelsea Manning case what he can expect if a U.S. extradition warrant is successful \u2014 a United Nations Special Rapporteur called it torture.\nI know Julian Assange well; I regard him as a close friend, a person of extraordinary resilience and courage. I have watched a tsunami of lies and smear engulf him, endlessly, vindictively, perfidiously; and I know why they smear him.\nIn 2008, a plan to destroy both WikiLeaks and Assange was laid out in a top secret document dated 8 March, 2008. The authors were the Cyber Counter-intelligence Assessments Branch of the U.S. Defence Department.

The aim was to silence and criminalise WikiLeaks and its editor and publisher. It was as if they planned a war on a single human being and on the very principle of freedom of speech.\nVichy Media\nTheir main weapon would be personal smear. Their shock troops would be enlisted in the media \u2014 those who are meant to keep the record straight and tell us the truth.\nThe irony is that no one told these journalists what to do. I call them Vichy journalists \u2014 after the Vichy government that served and enabled the German occupation of wartime France.\nLast October, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Sarah Ferguson interviewed Hillary Clinton, over whom she fawned as \u201cthe icon for your generation\u201d.\nThis was the same Clinton who threatened to \u201cobliterate totally\u201d Iran and, who, as U.S. secretary of State in 2011, was one of the instigators of the invasion and destruction of Libya as a modern state, with the loss of 40,000 lives. Like the invasion of Iraq, it was based on lies.\nWhen the Libyan President was murdered publicly and gruesomely with a knife, Clinton was filmed whooping and cheering. Thanks largely to her, Libya became a breeding ground for ISIS and other jihadists. Thanks largely to her, tens of thousands of refugees fled in peril across the Mediterranean, and many drowned.\nWikiLeaks Exposed Clinton\nLeaked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s foundation \u2013 which she shares with her husband \u2013 received millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the main backers of ISIS and terrorism across the Middle East.\nAs Secretary of State, Clinton approved the biggest arms sale ever \u2014 worth $80 billion \u2014 to Saudi Arabia, one of her foundation\u2019s principal benefactors. Today, Saudi Arabia is using these weapons to crush starving and stricken people in a genocidal assault on Yemen.\nSarah Ferguson, a highly paid reporter, raised not a word of this with Hillary Clinton sitting in front of her.\nInstead, she invited Clinton to describe the \u201cdamage\u201d Julian Assange did \u201cpersonally to you\u201d. In response, Clinton defamed Assange, an Australian citizen, as \u201cvery clearly a tool of Russian intelligence\u201d and \u201ca nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator\u201d.\nShe offered no evidence \u2014 nor was asked for any \u2014 to back her grave allegations.\nAt no time was Assange offered the right of reply to this shocking interview, which Australia\u2019s publicly-funded state broadcaster had a duty to give him.\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, Ferguson\u2019s executive producer, Sally Neighour, followed the interview with a vicious re-tweet: \u201cAssange is Putin\u2019s bitch. We all know it!\u201d\nThere are many other examples of Vichy journalism. The Guardian, reputedly once a great liberal newspaper, conducted a vendetta against Julian Assange.

Awards were lavished and celebrated as if Julian Assange did not exist.\nMaligning and Profiting off Assange\nWikiLeaks\u2019 revelations became part of the Guardian\u2019s marketing plan to raise the paper\u2019s cover price. They made money, often big money, while WikiLeaks and Assange struggled to survive. With not a penny going to WikiLeaks, a hyped Guardian book led to a lucrative Hollywood movie deal. The book\u2019s authors, Luke Harding and David Leigh, gratuitously abused Assange as a \u201cdamaged personality\u201d and \u201ccallous\u201d.\nThey also revealed the secret password Julian had given the Guardian in confidence and which was designed to protect a digital file containing the U.S. embassy cables.\nWith Assange now trapped in the Ecuadorean embassy, Harding, who had enriched himself on the backs of both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, stood among the police outside the embassy and gloated on his blog that \u201cScotland Yard may get the last laugh\u201d.\nThe question is why.\nJulian Assange has committed no crime. He has never been charged with a crime. The Swedish episode was bogus and farcical and he has been vindicated.\nKatrin Axelsson and Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape summed it up when they wrote, \u201cThe allegations against [Assange] are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape, murder and destruction\u2026 The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will.\u201d\nThis truth was lost or buried in a media witch-hunt that disgracefully associated Assange with rape and misogyny. The witch-hunt included voices who described themselves as on the left and as feminist. They willfully ignored the evidence of extreme danger should Assange be extradited to the United States.\nAccording to a document released by Edward Snowden, Assange is on a \u201cManhunt target list\u201d. One leaked official memo says: \u201cAssange is going to make a nice bride in prison. Screw the terrorist. He\u2019ll be eating cat food forever.\u201d\nIn Alexandra, Virginia \u2013 the suburban home of America\u2019s war-making elite \u2014 a secret grand jury, a throwback to the middle ages \u2014 has spent seven years trying to concoct a crime for which Assange can be prosecuted.\nThis is not easy; the U.S. Constitution protects publishers, journalists and whistleblowers. Assange\u2019s crime is to have broken a silence.\nThey Never Happened\nNo investigative journalism in my lifetime can equal the importance of what WikiLeaks has done in calling rapacious power to account. It is as if a one-way moral screen has been pushed back to expose the imperialism of liberal democracies: the commitment to endless warfare and the division and degradation of \u201cunworthy\u201d lives: from Grenfell Tower to Gaza.\nWhen Harold Pinter accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, he referred to \u201ca vast tapestry of lies up on which we feed\u201d.

That is why Assange is in mortal danger.\nSeven years ago, in Sydney, I arranged to meet a prominent Liberal Member of the Federal Parliament, Malcolm Turnbull.\nI wanted to ask him to deliver a letter from Gareth Peirce, Assange\u2019s lawyer, to the government. We talked about his famous victory \u2014 in the 1980s when, as a young barrister, he had fought the British Government\u2019s attempts to suppress free speech and prevent the publication of the book Spycatcher \u2014 in its way, a WikiLeaks of the time, for it revealed the crimes of state power.\nThe prime minister of Australia was then Julia Gillard, a Labor Party politician who had declared WikiLeaks \u201cillegal\u201d and wanted to cancel Assange\u2019s passport \u2014 until she was told she could not do this: that Assange had committed no crime: that WikiLeaks was a publisher, whose work was protected under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia was one of the original signatories.\nIn abandoning Assange, an Australian citizen, and colluding in his persecution, Prime Minister Gillard\u2019s outrageous behaviour forced the issue of his recognition, under international law, as a political refugee whose life was at risk. Ecuador invoked the 1951 Convention and granted Assange refuge in its embassy in London.\nGillard has recently been appearing in a gig with Hillary Clinton; they are billed as pioneering feminists.\nIf there is anything to remember Gillard by, it a warmongering, sycophantic, embarrassing speech she made to the US Congress soon after she demanded the illegal cancellation of Julian\u2019s passport.\nMalcolm Turnbull is now the Prime Minister of Australia. Julian Assange\u2019s father has written to Turnbull. It is a moving letter, in which he has appealed to the prime minister to bring his son home. He refers to the real possibility of a tragedy.\nI have watched Assange\u2019s health deteriorate in his years of confinement without sunlight. He has had a relentless cough, but is not even allowed safe passage to and from a hospital for an X-ray.\nMalcolm Turnbull can remain silent. Or he can seize this opportunity and use his government\u2019s diplomatic influence to defend the life of an Australian citizen, whose courageous public service is recognised by countless people across the world.

According to the mayors:\nStrengthening the Regulation of Gun Sales and Dealers, including: Limiting the number of guns a person may purchase in a single transaction or in a month or other specified period of time;\nBanning replica handguns;\nIncreasing inspections of licensed gun dealers; and\nTargeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers; Banning Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines, including: Reinstating a strengthened, effective ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47s, and their component parts; and\nBanning large capacity ammunition feeding devices and the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips. Supporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents;\nProviding local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data;\nOpposing \"Stand Your Ground\"\u009d or \"Shoot First\"\u009d laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and\nEncouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools;\nRaising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age;\nBanning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns.\nProtecting Domestic Violence Victims, including:\nProhibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and\nRequiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own;\nHow any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess. I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people.\nHow does any of this stop gun violence? It doesn't. What it does do is infringe on the rights of teachers, law-abiding citizens who want to purchase several guns which they will use lawfully, sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime. Banning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban.\nThese geniuses also \"Support Enactment of Comprehensive Background Checks, Ban the Sale of Bump Stocks and Related Devices and Prevent the Arming of Teachers in Schools.\"\nAgain, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns. Why? Because they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!\nOn top of that, the criminal mayors want to institute red flag laws.\n\"The U.S. Conference of Mayors registers its strong support for extreme risk protection order laws and urges both states and the federal government to enact such laws,\" the group wrote.\nThey are fully in support of violating the Fifth Amendment rights of otherwise law-abiding citizens based on merely the fact that someone claims that a family member is a harm to themselves or others, even though they have not committed a crime. This is the Trump, \"Take the guns first and then due process\" mantra.\nGuns.com reported on some of the statements made by some of these mayors.\nKaren Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana and chairwoman of the conference\u2019s criminal and social justice committee, said gun-related tragedies \u201crips families and communities apart.\u201d \u201cPolicies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Freeman-Wilson said. \u201cThe U.S. Conference of Mayors will continue doing everything in our power to keep our communities safe so that children and families are able to live free of the fear of being gunned down.\u201d St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said the new resolutions show mayors will \u201clead the way in solving our gun violence crisis.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs as mayors if we weren\u2019t focusing on gun violence \u2014 an issue that threatens the public safety of every community, big and small,\u201d she said. \u201cOur bipartisan network of mayors knows how to work together and compromise on policies that save lives. If only our partners in Congress did the same.\u201d Gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, praised the conference for reaffirming its support for stricter regulations. \u201cMayors are on the frontlines of America\u2019s gun violence crisis, so it\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re also leading the charge to pass common-sense, life-saving laws,\u201d said Everytown president John Feinblatt. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our leaders in Washington to follow the lead of America\u2019s mayors and put public safety over NRA priorities.\u201d\nNone of these statements can be backed up by facts. The facts refute their arguments, but beyond that, the Second Amendment recognizes the right to keep and bear arms is a right given to us by our Creator, not a permission we gain from government.\nSo, while they tell you they support the Second Amendment and that their unlawful policies are consistent with it, nothing could be further from the truth.

In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.\nOn Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.\nThe attorney general had been accused of \u201csoftening or watering down his report,\u201d Gowdy said, \u201cWhen the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton. We see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election.\u201d\nIn a devastating exchange with Horowitz, Gowdy said that \u201cprejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends, and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins\u201d is the \u201ctextbook definition of bias.\u201d Democrats echoed the IG report\u2019s conclusion that there was no bias. Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads.\nThe IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system. Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so. Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to get back to you on that,\u201d Horowitz said, and the IG was \u201cnot sure\u201d if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material. If the IG did know the subject of the president\u2019s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details. Horowitz \u201cwould have to ask\u201d if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said \u201cnot the president himself.\u201d\nRep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of \u201cextremely careless\u201d for \u2018gross negligence,\u201d which violated a criminal statute. Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved. The IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton\u2019s server was \u201cnot clearly marked,\u201d which repeated one of Clinton\u2019s claims about her negligence.\nAs for the question of her \u201cintent,\u201d Horowitz said it arose \u201cmonths earlier,\u201d maybe in 2015, though he couldn\u2019t be sure. King said President Obama had suggested the \u201ccareless but not intentional\u201d language in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d appearance in October of 2015. And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used \u201cintent\u201d six times.\nHorowitz said Comey \u201cconcealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.\u201d The IG also described his report as a \u201cthorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.\u201d\nThe IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team. Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged \u201ctens of thousands of texts.\u201d Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump.\nHorowitz conceded that this meant \u201cstop Trump from becoming president.\u201d The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked \u201cwhy did we not see it until last Thursday?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that,\u201d Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein\u2019s department at the DOJ. Jordan concluded that Rosenstein \u201cmade the decision that we had to wait a month.\u201d\nSeveral representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named. \u201cThe FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,\u201d Horowitz said.\nRep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm. \u201cThey don\u2019t work in counterintelligence,\u201d said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG \u201cfalse information\u201d and altered key witness reports.\n\u201cHow did Comey see the report before it came out?\u201d Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know. Horowitz said Comey didn\u2019t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.\nBy the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others. Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok\u2019s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau\u2019s Russia probe.\nAlso on Tuesday Peter Strzok was \u201cescorted\u201d from the FBI building. As his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had \u201cplayed by the rules,\u201d but been targeted by \u201cunfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.\u201d\n\u201cI hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,\u201d Trey Gowdy told Fox News.

In 1949 he was sentenced to life in a show trial that generated worldwide condemnation.\nTwo weeks after the trial began in early 1949, Pope Pius XII (having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty. Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial.

It is as if a one-way moral screen has been pushed back to expose the imperialism of liberal democracies: the commitment to endless warfare \u2026 When Harold Pinter accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, he referred to \u2018a vast tapestry of lies up on which we feed.\u2019 He asked why \u2018the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of independent thought\u2019 of the Soviet Union were well known in the West while America\u2019s imperial crimes \u201cnever happened \u2026 even while [they] were happening, they never happened.\u2019\u201d\nWikiLeaks and 9/11: What if?\nIn an op-ed published several years ago by The Los Angeles Times, two members of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, Coleen Rowley and Bogdan Dzakovic, pointed out that \u2014 If WikiLeaks had been up and running before 9/11 \u2014 frustrated FBI investigators might have chosen to leak information that their superiors bottled up, perhaps averting the terrorism attacks.\n\u201cThere were a lot of us in the run-up to Sept. 11 who had seen warning signs that something devastating might be in the planning stages.

The citation read:\n\u201cIt seems altogether fitting and proper that this year\u2019s award be presented in London, where Edmund Burke coined the expression \u201cFourth Estate.\u201d Comparing the function of the press to that of the three Houses then in Parliament, Burke said: \u201c\u2026but in the Reporters Gallery yonder, there sits a Fourth Estate more important far then they all.\u201d The year was 1787\u2014the year the U.S. Constitution was adopted. The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference. That was then. With the Fourth Estate now on life support, there is a high premium on the fledgling Fifth Estate, which uses the ether and is not susceptible of government or corporation control. Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened. It has been said: \u201cYou shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\u201d WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie. Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only \u201con behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks\u2019 contributions are of no significance.\u201d We do not know if Pvt. Bradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated \u201csurge\u201d in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the \u201cmainstream\u201d journalist embedded in that same Army unit. He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply \u201cone bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,\u201d and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called \u201cThe Good Soldiers.\u201d Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks. We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future. Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.

No one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected.\nWhen it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign.\nIn 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21. They were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so. Since most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

Another excuse used by the Obama government was to bring them here to find their families already in the US.\nThus, the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new, done only by the Trump Administration is absurd, since we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents by the US government at that time, or not. We have only what little information the government told us then, which was not very much, considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible.\nWhat many do not realize is, today's policy of separating underage siblings from their parents once they cross the border illegally into the US seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015.\nMany remember the military taking over several Walmart locations, mainly in Texas, during the Jade Helm exercises. This, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people. Since Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time, along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in, one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land, as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in.\nDespite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26, 2017 while security measures were reviewed, the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone, up from 85,000 the previous year. These numbers follow Obama's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US. Of course, as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county, the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number.\nWhat we seem to have here with the illegal immigration situation today is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive with separating children from their families once they cross the Mexican border into the US. When in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power. What they do not want to admit to is the fact that today's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy.\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, is following along with it by detaining illegal immigrants at the border and separating children from their apparent families. Since no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents, they are separated until that can be verified, along with other background findings.\nThe bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees. All of which seems to be a planned event.\nIn any case, neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved. If they were, there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US, only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot.\n", ["Name_Calling-Labeling", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Repetition"]], ["Muslim Cleric: \u201cThere Were Jews In Islamic Countries & Caliphates, But We Never Killed Them Just For Being Jews\u201d\nWhen he says that Muslims never killed Jews just for being Jews, he is lying, and relying on the historical ignorance of his audience.

The video was also posted on the Facebook account of Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center. Following is a transcript: Jihad Al-\u2018Ayesh: \u201cSome people have shown up with a new fashion. We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies. This is, indeed, a new fashion. Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call \u2018the Holocaust.\u2019 [\u2026] \u201cDid the Nazi annihilation \u2013 the Holocaust \u2013 target only the Jews? Anybody? The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million. What we have here are historical errors. First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie. In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler. So was it annihilation? Yes, it was. Who did Hitler annihilate? He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German. Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases. Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only. [\u2026] \u201cHitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide. Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West. Hitler embodies one type of modern Western annihilation. When the Americans occupied the republics of the Indians, they annihilated millions of human beings. It is said that they annihilated 50-100 hundred million, but nobody ever mentions this. [\u2026] \u201cWas there annihilation? Yes. Many races were annihilated. The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor. Many people were tortured and were starved to death there. [\u2026] \u201cThe Jews were banished, tortured, and annihilated because of their deeds. They were not banished for being Jews. There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews. No, it never happened. Hitler and the Nazi state knew the truth about the Jews, and therefore, they began tormenting and persecuting them. [\u2026] \u201cThat is when the Final Solution began. The Nazis called it the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 of the Jews. When we say \u2018Final Solution,\u2019 we realize that many of the terms used by the Zionist state constitute Nazi terms, ideas, and notions. It is as if they are two faces of the same coin. [\u2026] \u201cSince Germany and Europe did not want the Jews, the Nazis came up with the idea of sending the Jews to another country. The Nazis suggested Madagascar, Ecuador, or an Arab country \u2013 Syria. But after a while, the Nazis discovered that there were groups of Jews calling for the establishment of a state. They were calling for a Zionist state. That is when the idea of deporting the Jews to Palestine arose\u2026.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Straw_Man", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Whataboutism"]], ["Who \u2018Won\u2019 the Trump-Kim Summit?\nLast week\u2019s Economist Magazine won the day with the best-ever headline about the Trump-Kim Jong-un summit: `Kim Jong Won!\u2019\nThat said it all.

Eric Margolis Best Price: $5.99 Buy New $45.86 (as of 09:30 EDT - Details) Trump\u2019s objectives, at least initially, were to crush North Korea and the threats it could pose to the United States and its regional allies Japan and South Korea. Trump sought to set up Kim as a bogeyman, and himself as America\u2019s savior. Trump knew perfectly well that he could not destroy all of North Korea\u2019s deeply buried nuclear-armed missiles, and, in spite of his huffing and puffing, had no stomach for an invasion of North Korea that could cost the US an estimated 250,000 casualties.\nSo Trump\u2019s solution was more show-biz. A much ballyhooed flight to Singapore, backslapping a delighted Kim, and a love-fest between the two chunky leaders was sold to Americans as the dawn of peace. America\u2019s media was quick to retail the story and burnish Trump\u2019s credentials among the seriously credulous. No more hiding under your school desks or in dank basements. As Trump grandly proclaimed, Americans no longer have to fear North Korea and can sleep peacefully at night!\nWhy? Korea still has all of its medium and long-ranged missiles and an estimated 40 or more nuclear warheads. The North is developing submarines that can launch nuclear-armed missiles from underwater off America\u2019s coasts. For Kim, these weapons are purely defensive, designed to prevent a US attack on his nation. But he is now a full-fledged member of the nuclear club.\nEqually important, North Korea still has an estimated 14,000 170mm guns and hundreds of 300mm long-ranged rocket launchers emplaced in caves just north of the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas. They threaten almost all of South Korea\u2019s capital Seoul north of the Han River and some US military bases and key airfields, notably Osan.\nThis is a very real threat \u2013 one that is largely immune to attack from the air.

But it was agreed to temporarily stop the highly provocative US/South Korean war games simulating an invasion of the North, a key demand by Kim. This column has been calling for their end for a decade. North Korea will seemingly halt its missile tests.\nThis is not the \u2018denuclearization\u2019 of North Korea that has been bandied about. There may be a few gestures of disarmament but Kim must know that his nukes are his means of survival. In case Kim didn\u2019t remember the dire fate of Iraq, Libya, and Syria, Trump\u2019s new national security advisor John Bolton, a fanatic\u2019s fanatic, cheerfully recalled the doom of Libya\u2019s murdered Col. Khadaffi.\nThe Singapore summit was also a huge humiliation for America\u2019s allies Japan and South Korea. In Asia, preserving \u2018face\u2019 is essential.\nTrump completely ignored America\u2019s two old allies after his meeting with Kim \u2013 who routinely blasts Japan and South Korea as \u2018America\u2019s stooges.\u2019 Instead, Trump sent his beginner Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain what happened in Singapore, inflicting a deep loss of face on Tokyo and Seoul. This was a terrible insult and could spark decisions by at least Japan to proceed ahead with its covert nuclear program. Japan can deploy nuclear weapons in 3-6 months; South Korea is not far behind.\nThe United States and North Korea are now on a more civilized level of behavior. But nothing basic has been resolved. Maybe Trump has some more concessions up his sleeve, like cutting the number of US troops in the South.

The secret memo also said more than \u201c40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.\u201d\nIn the memo, Congress\u2019s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote, \u201cWe have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members\u2019 capacity to serve constituents.\u201d\nThe memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The letter bolsters TheDCNF\u2019s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill.\nIt details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans\u2019 physical access was not blocked.\nBut after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.\nThe memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.\nRep. Louie Gohmert \u2014 a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case \u2014 said the missing server contained copies of Congress members\u2019 emails.\n\u201cThey put 40 members of Congress\u2019s data on one server \u2026 That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,\u201d he said.\nMultiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen.\n\u201cThey [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server\u201d to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged. \u201cIt was a breach. The data was completely out of [members\u2019] possession.\u201d\nThe six-page letter says:\n\u2022 In September of 2016 \u2026 the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified. As a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers.\n\u2022 The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police. The USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day.\n\u2022 In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position. The CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server.\n\u2022 While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September. [Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee\u2019s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation. [A House source said the \"employee\u201d was Abid Awan.]\n\u2022 The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server.\n\u2022 On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP.\nPresident Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus\u2019 missing server in a tweet. But because the letter to the CHA was kept secret, many news outlets have not grasped that the House\u2019s top cop documented a \u201cmissing server\u201d connected to the Democratic Caucus.\nThe timeline laid out in the letter also shows that Becerra \u2014 now California\u2019s Democratic attorney general \u2014 failed to ensure that the Awans didn\u2019t have access to House computer systems during the 2016 election, which was wrought with cybersecurity scandals.\nAn IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.\n\u201cThe Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,\u201d it read. \u201cThis shared employee continued.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why that request was not granted or why it was a request rather than an order.\nA House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus\u2019s payroll.

Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud.\nThe FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud. Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud.\nA Democratic IT aide who alleged that Imran solicited a bribe from him told TheDCNF he believes members of Congress are playing dumb and covering the matter up. Wendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported.\nEighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo, prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained.

Wilson made the decision to go all in on the project, dropping out of law school at the University of Texas, as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law.\nThe law caught up.

SAF and Defense Distributed had filed suit against the State Department under the Obama administration, challenging a May 2013 attempt to control public speech as an export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a Cold War-era law intended to control exports of military articles. Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue. The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint. Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber \u2013 including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms \u2013 are not inherently military. \u201cNot only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,\u201d noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. \u201cFor years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called \u2018weapons of war,\u2019 and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort. \u201cUnder this settlement,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case. They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech. That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.\u201d The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation\u2019s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.

Well, it's pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation. Why? Because now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered. That's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so.\nAnd we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun. We're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns. This actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.\nWilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control.\n\"I barely put a million bucks into this and I got you the Second Amendment forever,\" he told The Daily Wire in a phone interview. \"What has the NRA done for you lately?\"\nI don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that \"the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber \u2013 including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms \u2013 are not inherently military.\" Therefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.\n\"This doesn\u2019t put the rifle in everyone\u2019s hand, but it does that in essence\" he added. \"The DNA of our culture is preserved. This is the first pillar in the internet gun culture of tomorrow, and it is permanent.\"\nThis is a huge milestone in the history of our county, and as such, it should be celebrated as a victory.

The presstitute media instead of protesting this attempt at a coup against the President of the United States, trumpet the accusation as self-evident truth. Trump is a traitor because he wants peace with Russia.\nHere is Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer (NY) repeating Pelosi\u2019s false accusation: \u201cMillions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump.\u201d If you don\u2019t believe that this is orchestrated between Pelosi and Schumer, you are stupid beyond belief.\nHere is disgraced Obama CIA director John Brennan, a leader of the fake Russiagate campaign against President Trump in order to prevent Trump from making peace with Russia and, thus, by making the world safer, threatening the massive, unjustified budget of the military/security complex: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors.

HOW CAN THIS BE? HOW CAN IT BE THAT THE WESTERN MEDIA IS SO OPPOSED TO PEACE?

Just go and investigate the donations to their re-election campaigns. The 1,000 billion dollar budget of the military/security complex, amplified by the CIA\u2019s front corporations and narcotics business, provides enormous sums with which to purchase the senators and representatives that the insouciant American voters think that they elect.\nDo you know how large 1,000 billion is? You would have to live for thousands of years and do nothing for 24/7 except count to reach that figure. It is a sum that nurtures the recipients, and the recipients regard it as worth protecting.\nTherefore, the American public gets not representation, but lies that justify war and conflict. The military/security complex, about which President Eisenhower warned the American people to no effect, is in desperate need of an enemy. In obedience to the military/security complex, the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes have made Russia that enemy.

For example, during the last half of the 1970s I was a member of the US Senate staff. I was working together with a staffer of the US Republican Senator from California, S. I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget\u2019s ability to meet its obligations. Republican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure. The Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984). The Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit. The Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget. This was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups\u2019 handouts in order \u201cto cut tax rates for the rich.\u201d\nThe supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa\u2019s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.\nWhen the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48-year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder. He said: \u201cson, never set your senator up against the military/security complex. He will not be re-elected, and you will be out of a job.\u201d I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation. He replied: \u201cson, the military/security complex doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\nMy emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond\u2019s pat on my shoulder. It grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said. In the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president\u2019s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it. Later as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.\nToday, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us. Trump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government. The rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as \u201canti-American.\u201d\nIf Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column\u2014the Atlanticist Integrationists\u2014the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane. Their delusions are setting themselves up for destruction. There is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted. Any government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.\nThe entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein. The purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons. One is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia. The other is to remove Trump\u2019s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party. How America Was Lost: ...

And Trump cannot indict Hillary for her numerous unquestionable crimes in plain view of everyone, or Comey or Brennan, who declares Trump \u201cto be wholly in the pocket of Putin,\u201d for trying to overthrow the elected president of the United States. Trump cannot have the Secret Service question the likes of Pelosi and Schumer and McCain and Lindsey Graham for false accusations that encourage assassination of the President of the United States.\nTrump cannot even trust the Secret Service, which accumulated evidence suggests was complicit in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.\nIf Putin and Lavrov, so anxious to be friends of Washington, let their guards down, they are history.\nAs I said above, Russiagate is an orchestratration to prevent peace between the US and Russia. Leading military/security complex experts, including the person who provided the CIA\u2019s daily briefing of the President of the United States for many years, and the person who devised the spy program for the National Security Agency, have proven conclusively that Russiagate is a hoax designed for the purpose of preventing President Trump from normalizing relations between the US and Russia, which has the power to destroy the entirety of the Western World at will.\nHere is the report from the retired security professionals who, unlike those still in office, cannot be fired and deprived of a careet for telling the truth.\nHere is what the clued-in Russian Defense Minister Shoigu has to say about the aggressive actions of the West against the Russian homeland.\nIf Putin doesn\u2019t listen to him, Russia is in the trash can of history.\nKeep in mind that no media informs you better than my website. If my website goes down, you will be left in darkness. No valid information comes from the US government or the Western presstitutes. If you sit in front of the TV screen watching the Western media, you are brainwashed beyond all hope. Not even I can rescue you. Nor God himself.\nAmericans, and indeed the Russians themselves, are incapable of realizing it, but there is a chance that Trump will be overthrown and a Western assault will be launched against the handful of countries that insist on sovereignty.\nI doubt that few of the Americans who elected Trump will be taken in by the anti-Trump propagana, but they are not organized and have no armed power. The police, militarized by George W. Bush and Obama, will be set against them. The rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.\nIn the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead\u2014freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus. Today there are no countries less free than the United States of America.\nWhy do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world? Are they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?\nIf Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.\nThere is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington. Apparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism. The Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington\u2019s hegemony is negotiable.\nThe Best of Paul Craig Roberts\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Conversation_Killer", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Newt Gingrich: The truth about Trump, Putin, and Obama\nPresident Trump\u2019s summit Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy. President Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies.\nThe initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin. It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected \u2013 immediately.\u201d\nAfter flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has \u201cfull faith and support for America\u2019s great intelligence agencies\u201d and that he accepts \u201cour intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place.\u201d\nIn his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki. The president said: \u201cIt should have been obvious \u2013 I thought it would be obvious \u2013 but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn\u2019t. In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u201cwouldn\u2019t.\u201d The sentence should have been: I don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 or why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia. So just to repeat it, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u2018wouldn\u2019t\u2019 \u2026\n\u201cI have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections. Unlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts \u2013 and repel \u2013 we will stop it, we will repel it \u2013 any efforts to interfere in our elections. We\u2019re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.\u201d\nAnyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake. His natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes. For him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).\nPresident Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration\u2019s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election. President Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nPresident Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now \u2013 probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks \u2013 they knew about Russia\u2019s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it. And as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win. It turned out it didn\u2019t happen that way.\n\u201cBy contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance \u2013 it\u2019s a very firm stance \u2013 on a strong action. We\u2019re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.\u201d\nThere are two key facts in this statement.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016. The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America. It was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not candidate Trump\u2019s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being. The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia. Also, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin. The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia:\nWhere President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia. Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nFinally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president.\nWe are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing. This is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback.\u201d With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more.\nWith President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked. In fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.\nSimilarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump. I think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt.\nWhatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. These former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt. Just keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.\nMy prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion"]], ["Biblical Illiterates Reverse Romans 13: Teach Submit to Tyranny!\nCaesar had his Brutus, Charles the first his Cromwell; And George the third- Treason!

Our American history found in that document teaches that our forefathers threw off the tyrant that would not be ruled by God and declared \u201cResistance to tyrants is obedience to God!\"\nFurthermore, the motto of the American Revolution was \u201cNo King but King Jesus.\u201d America\u2019s original national seal was \u201cREBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD\u201d with a picture on the inside of the seal showing the Pharaoh being overthrown by the sea with Moses and the children of Israel safe on the shore.\nJohn Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, said,\n\u201cResistance to tyranny becomes the Christian duty of each individual\u2026 Continue steadfast and, with a proper sense of your dependence on God, nobly defend those rights which Heaven gave, and no man ought to take from us.\u201d (History of the United States of America, Volume. 2 p. 229)\nApparently, this individual who wrote the article knows nothing of the Black Robed Regiment that the tyrant King George feared the most. The Black Robed regiment, were in fact, the preachers that went before the Forefathers in educating the colonies to resistance when it came to the corrupt King on the other side of the pond. They sacrificed themselves to establish the freedoms in which he enjoys today.\nThe author went on to write that this protestant should know what the Bible says about those in authority.\nFirst of all, the authority given to our representative government is derived from \u201cWe the People.\u201d\nWe receive our rights from God, and in turn, delegate power to those who serve \u201cWe the People.\u201d\nRepresentatives work for us, we do not work for them.\n\u201cThey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\u2026 Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d -The Declaration of Independence\nHe then quotes Romans 13: 1-7\nLet every soul be subject unto the higher powers.

Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:\nFor he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.\nWherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.\nFor for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.\nRender therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.\nThe first Scripture says:\nLet every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.\nGod ordained the power, and that \u201crulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.\"\nDid God tell His Church to submit to that which He condemns? (Deuteronomy 25:1; Proverbs 17:15) Absolutely not!\nIs the Church to transgress His Laws, or to magnify and enforce His Laws unto judgment? (Psalm 40:8; Romans 3:31) Of course not! If He did, that would make God unjust.\nJesus said, \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil\u201d (Matthew 5:17).\nThe Lord has, in fact, commanded nowhere in Scripture for the Church to submit to the wicked. The Bible teaches just the exact opposite. We are to \u201chave no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them\u201d (Ephesians 5:11).\nFurthermore, it would contradict what Scripture teaches us from Genesis all the way to Revelation every step of the way.\nThink of this: Those that serve \u201cWe the People,\u201d before taking office, swear to uphold the US Constitution with their hand on the Holy Bible. They are appointed to magnify law against crime, not crime against the law (Psalm 94:20). America is based on Common Law, the Mosaic Institution.

Absolutely not!\nSubmit to those who lie continuously, to them that steal and even kill? Absolutely not! Submit to what God condemns?\nYet, this is what the perverse, modern-day, professing Christians are teaching the sheep in the American Church today.\nIt would do you well to now look to the Christ when He said that we are to beware of the leaven of the Pharisee\u2019s (corrupt doctrines of those who claimed to be the children of God), as well as the leaven of Herod (corrupt doctrines of government) (Mark 8:15).\nIf you remember, it was those same people who called for the crucifixion of Christ while crying out \u201cWe have no King but Caesar\u201d (John 19:15).\nDo these that teach such heresy not realize that every apostle, except John, was killed by hostile corrupt civil authorities opposed to their endeavors?\nChristians throughout history were imprisoned, tortured, or killed by corrupt civil authorities of all stripes for refusing to submit to their various, lawless policies and prohibitions.\nDid Christian martyrs violate God\u2019s principles of submission to authority? Of course, not.\nAlso, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters.\nTake note that civil government is to be, and must be, a \u201cterror to good works.\u201d It has no power or authority to terrorize good works or good, law-abiding people. God never gave them that authority and any, and all, government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection.\nCivil government is a \u201cminister for God to thee for good\u201d (Romans 13:4). It is not a minister of God for evil. Civil magistrates have a divine duty to \u201cexecute wrath upon him that doeth evil.\u201d Anyone who teaches that they have authority to execute wrath upon \"him that doeth good\u201d is ignorant and uneducated in their misleadings (1 John 4:6).\nTo tell Christians to submit to evil civil authority is teaching the opposite of what is true. Common sense does come into play here.\nI ask, did Moses violate God's principle of submission when he was commanded by God, \u201cGo in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me\u201d (Exodus 9:1).\nAnd when Pharaoh refused, God plagued the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and set His children free.\nThink of this, the meekest man alive was sent to the face of the Pharaoh to tell him to obey or else. Is this what is being preached from the pulpits across America today?\nOr what of Gideon who was to deliver the Children of Israel from the Midianites? The first thing the Lord commanded him to do was to tear down his father's altars (Judges 6:25). Was this a violation of God's principles of submission? The sins of the fathers were the reason the Midianites had power to oppress them.\nWhat of that lone prophet, Elijah? The tyrant Ahab called him the troubler of Israel. Elijah set the record straight when he answered, \"I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim (1 Kings 18:18). Is this a violation of God's principles when it came to submission to authority?\nElijah took Ahab and the false prophets to the top of Mount Carmel where the God of Israel consumed the sacrifice by fire, and the false prophets were killed (1 Kings 18:38-40).\nWhat of King David? Was he violating God\u2019s principles of submission when he refused to surrender himself to Saul\u2019s troops?\nDavid was a king that was to overthrow corrupt governments by dispossessing them and establishing righteousness through justice and judgment (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 51:4).\nDid Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego violate God's principle of submission when they refused to worship King Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s image?\nThen the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nThen an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,\nThat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:\nAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. Daniel 3:3-6\nWhen they refused to submit to the tyrant, the furnace was heated up 7 times hotter so that the guards were consumed, only to have the fourth man, \u201clike the Son of man,\u201d show up to deliver them where the fire had no power over them, and not a hair of their heads was singed. In the end, Only the corrupt king acknowledges the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\n\u201cBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.\u201d Daniel 3:28\nDid Daniel violate God's principles of submission when he disobeyed the king's order to stop praying to any god but himself?\nKeep in mind that the punishment was that Daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which God sent forth an angel to protect him. His accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured Daniel (Daniel 6).\nWhat of Jeremiah? Was he violating God's principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings?\nFor, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. Jeremiah 1:18\nDon\u2019t forget about Amos, who was prophesying judgment upon the corrupt priests and the corrupt king of his day (Amos 7:10-16). Was that violating, or fulfilling God's principles and purposes?\nWhat of the New Testament? John the Baptist points out all of the evils of King Herod (Luke 3:19). Was this a violation of submission to civil government? No, it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and His laws.\nIs it a violation of submission to God's principles to keep preaching, \u201cRepent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins\u2026\u201d? Absolutely not! The corrupt Pharisees along with corrupt government did the opposite.\n\u201cBeing grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.\nAnd they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.\nHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.\nAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.\nAnd when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?\nThen Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,\nIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;\nBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.\nThis is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\nNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\nAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.\nBut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,\nSaying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.\nAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.\nBut Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\nFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.\u201d Acts 4:2-20\nOr what of the account found in Acts 12:1-11, where the Lord sent an Angel to liberate Peter from the hands of tyrants.\n\u201cNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.\nAnd he killed James the brother of John with the sword.\nAnd because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)\nAnd when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.\nPeter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.\nAnd when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.\nAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.\nAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\nAnd he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.\nWhen they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.\nAnd when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.\u201d\nOver and over again, you can see that the Church was to stand in protest against the wicked that were at war with Christ (Revelation 12:17), in dealing with not only the corrupt and wicked priests, but also the corrupt and wicked in government. as well as those who submitted to such.\nIt is important for people to know the Scriptures (History), lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39).\nNowhere in Scripture can you find the Lord telling His children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to His Word.

Truer words were never spoken by an American president. Shortly thereafter, the military/security complex assassinated President John F. Kennedy for working toward peace with Soviet leader Khrushchev. To get rid of President Nixon, who made too many arms control agreements with the Soviets and opened to China, the military/security complex used its asset, the Washington Post, to orchestrate the \u201cWatergate crisis\u201d that the military/security complex used to force Nixon\u2019s resignation. Now the military/security complex is openly inciting sedition against the President of the United States.

The heavy downloading in Spain, Brazil and Germany likely reflected attempts to evade extremely restrictive handgun regulations in those countries.\nWithin days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls. Wilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading.\nWithin a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world.\nIn 2015, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and DD sued the State Department, arguing that \"sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech. This is an important victory for First Amendment rights.\"\nThe Justice Department\u2019s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions \u201cfor public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form.\u201d The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilson\u2019s legal costs.\nWhile this settlement is a victory for First Amendment rights, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to regulate either the printers or the guns that are made with them.\nHow the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn\u2019t exactly obvious. Proposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated. Even if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them? And the designs for making your own printer have been available on the Internet for years.\n3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible. The government is not going to be able to ban guns, and limits on the size of bullet magazines will be even more laughable than before. Many parts of a gun can be made on very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even from simple machine tools.\nIt will be even more difficult to impose background checks, which have proven quite useless anyway. The government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs. That isn\u2019t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns.\nThis was a tough battle for the plaintiff's, SAF and DD. They lost many lower court rulings. Gun-control advocates believe that the government \"capitulated\" too soon. J.

The only thing that changed was the administration.\u201d\nThe concept of making guns with 3D printers in an age where just one year can render much technology obsolete shouldn't surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that instructions for gun assembly are easily available for download over the internet. At the click of a mouse, we can summon almost any information we could possibly need including instructions for making a bomb.\nThe ability to build an untraceable, unregistered gun is definitely a game changer.

It\u2019s clear that even the \u201cgood bishops\u201d have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.\nAs I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that \u201cthe US bishops gave themselves a pass\u201d on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter \u201ca thing that brazenly shifted blame.\u201d And it seems that though they\u2019re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren\u2019t having it.\nWe are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years. The Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are. The McCarrick news \u2013 and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga \u2013 has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it. The scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.\nRod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang. It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one \u201cbad apple\u201d or even only a \u201cfew\u201d as the hapless \u201cconservative\u201d Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.

The \u2018conservatives\u2019 are complicit, too.\u201d In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm. Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the \u201cNew Church.\u201d\nA point that Dreher\u2019s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don\u2019t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat. In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2]. When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control. This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.\nAs Dreher reported,\nWhen predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates... Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex. If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared\u2026 And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered. Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles. When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men \u2014 priests, former priests, seminarians \u2014 who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger. Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.\nFor many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least. I\u2019ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it. How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation? Where are they to live? How are they to maintain themselves? These are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.\nAs men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs. In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest\u2019s material life. The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless. And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical. Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world. And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate. He will remain a pariah even among the so-called \u201cgood\u201d bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal\u2026 (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)\nI have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don\u2019t we\u2019ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we\u2019ll be homeless and penniless. We\u2019re unemployable in any other field.\u201d And as much as we might be tempted to say, \u201cWell suck it up, this is for the good of souls,\u201d the reality is that these are not small considerations. Many priests are getting older \u2013 many of them with health issues \u2013 and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.\nOf course there are some who don\u2019t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need. Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.\nBut I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops. I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end. As one of them said to me, \u201cThe old arrangement was, \u2018Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you. We\u2019ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.\u2019 The new arrangement is a perversion of that: \u2018Keep quiet and go along with it all and you\u2019ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we\u2019ll destroy you.\u2019\u201d\nSo what do we do? The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else. As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what. We need to start working together with faithful priests \u2013 while there still are some \u2013 to help them create practical material alternatives. If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.\nThe other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it\u2019s time we all started taking seriously. In response to the continued outrages of both \u201cgood\u201d and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing \u201can escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.\u201d\nI responded: \u201cAnd the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm. We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.\u201d\nI am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution. This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.\nI started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!] \u201cbegging\u201d those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house. I responded that this was going about things the wrong way. Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, \u201cbegging\u201d the hierarchy to maintain the Faith. First of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy. Let\u2019s not give them that, OK? There\u2019s already enough \u201cfrissons of pleasure\u201d in their lives.\nSecond, it\u2019s simply not going to work. In Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain\u2026 throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the \u201cinstitutional Church\u201d \u2013 that is, whose names are on the bank accounts \u2013 are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve. The wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful. They are, in short, our enemies. They\u2019ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church. They know it and it\u2019s time we stopped imagining otherwise.\nThe other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.\nThere\u2019s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily. No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he\u2019s a faithful Catholic. We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner. He should own a house or stand to inherit one. Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.\nAnd more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood. Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work. But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on. How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf? Change the oil in a car? Rewire a house? The standard clich\u00e9 of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it\u2019s not even worth memeing anymore.\nHow many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong \u201csexual orientation\u201d? Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills. Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree. That\u2019s an economic asset that we can\u2019t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.\nDon't miss Hilary White's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper; Subscribe today!\nIt reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations. One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first. This college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap. This is fine, good idea. But I asked him what he knew how to do. \u201cCan you fix a bathroom pipe? Do you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow? Can you drive a tractor?\u201d This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.\nThere is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions. Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology? Wouldn\u2019t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor? Or for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker? If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska. I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.\nYoung men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day. Simply put, they\u2019ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy. This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time. The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I\u2019m going to ask, \u201cHow sound is your investment portfolio?\u201d The next candidate for religious life, I\u2019ll ask, \u201cGreat! What\u2019s your trade? What do you have to fall back on?\u201d\nI\u2019m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.\nMeanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it. That monastery in Germany is lost. Those bishops want the property and they\u2019ll get it. What the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment. Bishops won\u2019t protect and support good priests? Then it\u2019s up to us. The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern? We\u2019re not helpless. We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.\nOur goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.\nI am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army. They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world. Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals. Two trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.\nThe museum\u2019s website tells us:\n\u201cDespite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions. With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain. Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area. Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.\u201d \u201cHermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles. No items were lost during the evacuation.\u201d\nTo keep up everyone\u2019s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed. They understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.\nDoes this all sound a bit, well, schismatic? Not necessarily. Any bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets, who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf, is welcome to join us. But we\u2019d be fools to wait for them. Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre\u2019s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for which he was preparing has come at last. And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.\nThe simple fact is that soon there are going to be \u201cvagus\u201d priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith. There are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII. I think it\u2019s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.\nWhat we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and \u201cbeg\u201d bishops to maintain and defend the Faith. It\u2019s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith. Sentiment isn\u2019t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.\nIf it is true that we really are alone in this, then so be it. Let\u2019s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.\n___________________________________\n[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis\u2019 Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin. It should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d with the group\u2019s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ. He joined in 1966, was ordained in \u201978, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983. This period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr. Maciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion\u2019s leadership was covering. The Farrell family\u2019s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015. A recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related \u201clay\u201d organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks. After he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl. So close is he to McCarrick that Farrell\u2019s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor. So, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.\n[2] It should also be noted that in his book, The Dictator Pope, historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated, collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards. The natural question, \u201cWhy does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him?\u201d is now easy to answer.\n", ["Conversation_Killer", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["French Authorities Blame Attack by Muslim Shouting, \"Allahu Akbar\" on \"Excitement\"\nOver-excitement is a serious problem in the Muslim world.

On the loose, Malek cut a man\u2019s throat. He also stabbed two others. Police shot him in the leg, ruled out terrorism and blamed mental illness. In December of last year, Saleh Ali, a Syrian refugee wearing a keffiyah and waving a terrorist PLO flag, went up to a Jewish restaurant in Amsterdam, shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and began smashing the windows.

And there are so many important things that they are involved with that we care about, whether it\u2019s Syria, Ukraine, North Korea or nuclear arms. I\u2019m kind of surprised there\u2019s been this much angst over this press conference. Not that he said things the way he should have. President Trump really did mess up with that press conference but I don\u2019t quite know what people want. He actually is pretty tough on Russia. And in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the military budget, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the intelligence budget. We are doing NATO exercises in the Baltics. We provided legal aid to Ukraine and Georgia. We\u2019re developing low-yield nuclear weapons. He implemented sanctions that were even stronger than required by Congressional mandate. So if you care about actual actions, I think there\u2019s a lot to be happy about in terms of a tough posture towards Russia. People are obsessed about words and they should maybe focus on the actions as well.\nFormer Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred with Hemingway arguing that by any standard Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016. The very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America. It was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not candidate Trump\u2019s. Second, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being. The Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior. The Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia. Also, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy. Furthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin. The stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has. Beyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression. When the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States. When the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. President Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York. More than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons. Despite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia. Nothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nAny intellectually honest review of the last decade of foreign policy would lead one to admit that President Trump has most assuredly been tougher on Putin and Russia than Obama ever was.\nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Liberals Agree \u2013 Trump Tougher on Putin than Obama Was\nLeftwing journalist Glenn Greenwald is no fan of President Trump\u2019s policies, but he simply cannot understand how the leftwing media keeps getting so riled up at everything that Trump does.\nIn Greenwald\u2019s mind, Trump is a fairly standard politician (when it comes to the policies he supports and implements), which is what makes the media\u2019s constant flow of outrage so mystifying.\nIn a recent debate over the Helsinki Hulabaloo, Greenwald told the leftists at Democracy Now! that getting all worked up over Trump\u2019s press conference with Putin was ridiculous.

Number one is, if you look at President Obama versus President Trump, there\u2019s no question that President Obama was more cooperative with and collaborative with Russia and the Russian agenda than President Trump. President Trump has sent lethal arms to Ukraine\u2014a crucial issue for Putin\u2014which President Obama refused to do. President Trump has bombed the Assad forces in Syria, a client state of Putin, something that Obama refused to do because he didn\u2019t want to provoke Putin. Trump has expelled more Russian diplomats and sanctioned more Russian oligarchs than [Obama] has. Trump undid the Iran deal, which Russia favored, while Obama worked with Russia in order to do the Iran deal. So this idea that Trump is some kind of a puppet of Putin, that he controls him with blackmail, is the kind of stuff that you believe if you read too many\nTom Clancy novels but isn\u2019t borne out by the facts. The other issue that I want to make is that, you know, again, this idea that somehow that you are endorsing the repression of other countries\u2019 leaders if you meet with them\u2014it is true that Trump has never criticized Putin, although he has taken all the steps I just outlined against Putin. But he\u2019s also never criticized Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u2019s also never criticized the incredibly repressive leaders of Saudi Arabia. He\u2019s never criticized the fascist president of the Philippines. It is true President Trump likes fascist and authoritarian leaders, and that is a problem, but it\u2019s not like Putin is the only leader that he doesn\u2019t criticize.\nThe relevant portion of the debate begins about 21 minutes into the video:\nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Repetition"]], ["Army Colonel: False Flag \u2018Gulf of Tonkin Incident\u2019 May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran\nOften, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact \u2014 and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident \u2014 perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.\nOn August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, \u201cPresident Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and \u2018certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam\u2019 after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.\u201d Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.\nBut it wasn\u2019t true.

In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam \u2014 leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn\u2019t be disputed.\nTom Wells, author of the exhaustive expos\u00e9 \u201cThe War Within: America\u2019s Battle Over Vietnam,\u201d explained the media egregiously erred in \u201calmost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information\u201d and \u201creluctance to question official pronouncements on \u2018national security issues.\u2019\u201d\nIf due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it\u2019s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.\nSadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. And now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran.\nAs President Donald Trump continues to surround himself with neocon warhawks, the drums are beating for war with Iran. The rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself \u2014 without provocation \u2014 began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation.\nOn Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new \u201cGulf of Tonkin incident\u201d could be used to drag us into it.\nCarlson mocked the neocons\u2019 claims that Iran is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to America, explicitly noting that \u201cvirtually every attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran\u2019s Sunni enemies.\u201d\nCarlson pointed out how the neocons are hellbent on pushing the Trump administration into a new war. \u201cIf there was ever a swamp in Washington you are looking at it \u2014 the foreign policy establishment \u2014 they are working overtime to ensnare the president in a mess in Iran,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that he understands exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nPointing out Trump\u2019s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran. However, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it.\n\u201cI think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,\u201d Col. Macgregor said. \u201cMany of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf. We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump\u2019s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.\u201d\nCarlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria\u2014twice.\nFor those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works. In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009. MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime. They are hardly quiet about it.\nAccording to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009. Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton.\nCoincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies\u2014during this training period\u2014until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane. To see what US intervention\u2014through military support and the support of \u2018protesters\u2019\u2014does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America\u2019s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump\u2019s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report. This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n\u201cThis is a memo that describes how we\u2019re going to take out seven countries in five years,\u201d Clark said. \u201cStarting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.\u201d\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.

All they would need to do is download a computer file and use a 3-D printer to stamp out a gun. No background check would weed out felons, those with mental illness, domestic abusers or possible terrorists. No serial number would allow police to trace a weapon used in a crime. And there would be no problem getting past metal detectors with a gun molded from high-quality plastic.\nPlans by a Texas organization to publish, starting Aug. 1, downloadable blueprints for 3-D-printed plastic firearms \u2014 so-called ghost guns \u2014 have rightly alarmed leading gun safety groups and law enforcement officials. Credit for this dangerous scenario \u2014 in which getting an AR-15-style rifle is just a matter of a few computer clicks \u2014 goes to the Trump administration for its inexplicable decision to settle a lawsuit it was on the verge of winning.\nThe case involves Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, who sued the government in 2015 after the State Department under the Obama administration made him take down do-it-yourself gunmaking blueprints he had posted online, saying they violated export regulations governing military hardware and technology. Mr. Wilson, an avowed anarchist who hopes for a world in which governments can\u2019t stop individuals from getting guns, claimed his First Amendment right to free speech was being violated. But he lost at every stage of litigation, including a refusal by the Supreme Court to review a decision that the code could not be published during the course of the lawsuit.\nSo it was stunning \u2014 but not surprising, given this administration\u2019s worship at the altar of gun rights \u2014 that the State Department elected last month to quietly settle the case. In addition to signing off on the public release of the 3-D printing tutorials, the State Department also agreed to pay nearly $40,000 of Mr. Wilson\u2019s legal fees. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out how this senseless decision was reached, and whether groups such as the National Rifle Association were involved. It, along with Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, tried unsuccessfully Friday to get a federal court in Texas to block what it called a \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d settlement.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo was pressed about the issue Wednesday during his appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cWhy on earth would the Trump administration make it easier for terrorists and gunmen to produce undetectable plastic guns?\u201d asked Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). Mr. Pompeo promised to \u201ctake a look at it.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not enough. Ghost guns are already a problem; they are used not just by lone shooters but as part of criminal enterprises. Releasing instructions for their manufacture, which now only circulate on the dark Web, will lead directly to the loss of more innocent lives. The administration should stop the State Department from going ahead with this foolhardy move, and Congress should act to plug the loopholes that these guns are designed to take advantage of.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["The Remnant Newspaper\nThe unmasking of McCarrick exposed the pervasive prelate coverup of homosexual sexual predation in the American Catholic Church. These swarmy power brokers have colluded far too long at the tragic expense of innocent boys and seminarians. For 60 years, Ted McCarrick roamed the halls of seminaries, harassing, raping, and assaulting young males around the world. His brother bishops all knew and they all stayed silent.\nHow fortuitous and revelatory that McCarrick, the Molester would divulge his personal role in the pre-Conclave lobbying effort to elect Jorge Bergoglio as Pope. The notorious lavender mafia anxiously sought a simpatico Pope to advance its reformist homosexual agenda.\nBergoglio was their man.\nThe now well known McCarrick Villanova Speech on October 13, 2013 where he relayed the story about a prominent Italian man who met with McCarrick to ask him to lobby for the election of Bergoglio to the papacy. In light of the McCarrick scandal, the conversation takes on new meaning...\nMcCarrick described the conversation with the Influential Roman:\n\u201cBefore we went into the General Congregation, a very interesting and influential Italian gentleman came to see me at the Seminary (where else?) where I was staying. We sat down and he\u2019s a very brilliant man, very influential in Rome and said he had a favor to ask of me back home in the U.S., but then he said:\u201d\nInfluential Roman: What about Bergoglio?\nMolester McCarrick: I was surprised and said, What about Bergoglio?\nInfluential Roman: Does he have a chance?\nMolester McCarrick: I don\u2019t think so. No one has mentioned his name. He isn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s mind.\nInfluential Roman: He could do it you know.\nMolester McCarrick: What could he do?\nInfluential Roman: He could reform the Church. If you gave him 5 years, he could get us back on target. He\u2019s 76. If he had 5 years\u2014the Lord working through him, he could make the Church over again.\nMolester McCarrick: That\u2019s interesting.\nInfluential Roman: I know you are his friend.\nMolester McCarrick: I hope I am.\nInfluential Roman: Talk him up.\nMolester McCarrick'll vouch for ya, Francis! #bromance\nAnd talk him up, McCarrick the Molester did!\nOh, the irony! That the most prolific serial predator Cardinal would divulge the pre-Conclave Bergoglio plot to \u201creform the Church.\u201d Now we know what \u201creform the Church\u201d looks like in the Bergoglian papacy.\nYes, the clever and tyrannical Bergoglio, through his manipulation of synods, footnotes, exhortations, personal phone calls, airplane pressers, and correspondence has nearly completed his task of modernizing the Roman Catholic Church in the past 5 years.\nThe rallying cry for his homosexual modern agenda was sounded in his July 29, 2013 airplane presser. Who am I to judge set the tone for merciful embrace of homosexual priests. After 5 long years, his unrelenting mercy mantra seemingly extends only to homosexual clerics, not to the laity or clergy victims who protest the cover ups by prelates. Francis\u2019 wink and nod to the homosexual lifestyle landed him on the cover of the Advocate, the gay magazine, as its Man of the Year. He lapped up the accolades from the secular culture and main stream media. Yet, fame is and predation is unrelenting, even for Popes.\nIn the words of Queen Elizabeth, this year has been annus horribilis for Francis. Excuse the gay slang pun but, the chickens have come home to roost. The cascading revelations of papal sex scandals are toppling the barque of Peter.\nWill Catholic laity pay attention and take action?\nThe McCarrick scandal created an earthquake in the Catholic Church with aftershocks that will last for years. The timing is eerily propitious and providential based on the 5 year deadline. Will the laity step up and reclaim our hijacked Catholic Church?\nThis critical time in the history of the Catholic Church demands that the laity step forward to protect the Church, its children and seminarians from predators. We must close ranks before another precious child is exploited, a holy seminarian is violated, or another homosexual orgy is covered up at the Vatican.\nThe first order of business is to scuttle the upcoming October Synod on Young People, the Faith, and Vocational Discernment. Remember that influential Roman gentleman friend of McCarrick who said that Bergoglio could reform the Church in 5 years? Bergoglio\u2019s upcoming Synod on Young People will serve as the culminating vehicle for the 5 year modernist reform of the St. Gallen Mafia.\nThis Synod is designed to exploit the youth, like they\u2019ve been doing for the last 60 years.\nIf it weren\u2019t so infuriating, it would be laughable that following the McCarrick scandal of sexual predation of young males and seminarians, by a Cardinal, and covered up by Bishops, the Catholic Church would host a Synod of Bishops on the topic of young people and vocations! Furthermore, this nightmare of a \u201csinod\" is inviting youth from ages 16-29 to mingle with the Bishops to discuss the Church, faith and vocations.\nAre you thoroughly disgusted by this farce?\nThe Bishops have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect young people and seminarians from predators. The ever growing global list of Bishops and Cardinals that have preyed on /and or covered up the sexual abuse of minors and seminarians over the last 60 years continues to enrage the laity. We are no longer Shocked, just fed up.\nLet\u2019s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life. As the DC roommate and protege of Ted McCarrick, Farrell so respected McCarrick, the Molester, that he fashioned his Coat of Arms as a tribute to Uncle Ted.\nFarrell\u2019s pathetic and laughable defense \u201cI never knew anything about McCarrick\u201d video highlights the continuing conspiracy of denial by the U.S. Catholic hierarchy. Undoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr. James Martin, S.J. to keynote the Synod. Farrell\u2019s graciously offers notorious praise for Martin\u2019s new book, Building a Bridge (to hell, ed.) exposes his obvious underlying homosexual agenda and aura of the upcoming Synod:\n\u201cA welcome and much-needed book that will help bishops, priests, pastoral associates, and all church leaders more compassionately minister to the LGBT community. It will also help LGBT Catholics feel more at home in what is, after all, their church.\u201d\nWhat merciful praise for Martin\u2019s book, Cardinal Farrell! Contrary to the theme of mercy and compassion to LGBTs, it appears that your mentor, McCarrick set out to groom and grow an LGBT community. Clearly, you and Fr. Martin have much in common since you both claimed you were \u201cshocked\u201d by the McCarrick allegations.\nExplain to Catholics why would you headline a homosexual affirming speaker at a Synod for youth and seminarians? In case you haven\u2019t been reading the McCarrick headlines or noticing the plunging mass attendance and collections, Catholics don\u2019t trust their boys around priests and are furious that their seminarians are subjected to unrelenting homosexual sexual harassment.\nMcCarrick is the last straw. All credibility is lost.\nThe October Synod is yet another example of Church leaders exploiting Catholic youth for their own personal power agenda and selfish motives. Bergoglio\u2019s five year plan is nearly complete. Catholics must shed their trust and naivety in the papacy and bishops\u2019 conference. Dare, if you will, to read the thrill, the excitement and anticipated results of the Synod in the radical New Ways Gay Catholic Ministry article, entitled, Youth Synod Document shows Vatican evolution on LGBT Topics. The article highlights the New Ways excitement over the shift in the Vatican approach to the LGBT issues at the Synod:\n\u201cAnother significant development is the acknowledgement that LGBT people have a desire to be part of the church. In one section, the document states: \u201csome LGBT youth \u2026 wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care from the Church.\u201d \u201cThis acknowledgement is a welcome change from the hierarchy\u2019s traditional rhetoric that suggests LGBT people are opposed to religion. As New Ways Ministry knows from over 40 years of pastoral work with the LGBT community, LGBT Catholics have a deep spirituality, often forged by remarkable journeys overcoming rejection, alienation, and marginalization. LGBT Catholics have stayed a part of the church, despite statements and actions which have offended and hurt them.\u201d\nThe New Ways article highlights the efforts of Cardinal Kevin Farrell and his Vatican cronies to promote the LGBT agenda for the upcoming Synod:\n\u201cA third development is that the document shows that Vatican officials paid attention to concerns about LGBT issues which were raised by youth at a pre-synod meeting in Rome during March of this year, and also from youth around the world who made their views known to the Vatican online.\u201d\nAnd what of the infamous Instrumentum Laboris, drafted by the crafty Cardinal Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, noteworthy of the infamous First Synod on the Family? Known for his manipulative polls and magical modernistic results, Baldisseri infamously stated that \u201cdogma has its own evolution.\u201d Baldisseri stayed true to his modernist form and agenda and to the delight of the New Ways Ministry, he announced at the Vatican press conference that his office is using for the first time ever the LGBT acronym to refer to gay people in a spirit of inclusion.\nLest there be any doubt about the secret agenda and outcome of this Synod, Cardinal Baldisseri raises the exclusion rainbow flag. Baldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to \u201cmake the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.\u201d\nThis papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion.\nNot surprisingly, Baldisseri never once mentions that dreaded word, dogma in the Instrumentum Laboris, but effuses about accompaniment 136 times! This doltish and dimwitted document wreaks of psycho babble, insults the intelligence of young people, and will destroy the future of the Church.\nWelcome to the dumbing down of the Catholic Faith by the St. Gallen Mafia and their don, Jorge Bergoglio.\nThis Synod will exploit the youth and seminarians, just like Ted McCarrick. The handwriting is all over the 37 foot Vatican wall.\nThe time to take a stand against this radical hijacking of Holy Mother Church is now. Expose and rout every last predator. Purge every homosexual from its clerical ranks.\n#StopTheSynod.\nIt has all the markings of a Gay Pride Rally.\n__________________________________________\nElizabeth Yore is an attorney and international child rights advocate who has investigated clergy sex abuse cases.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Federal Judge Overrides DOJ & Violates First Amendment: Blocks 3D-Printed Gun Plans\nIn July, I reported that the Department of Justice finally settled with Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over his 3D-print gun plans being lawful.

The company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday. The temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.

In fact, the agreement states that it \"does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.\" The lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms. Washington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals. That system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.\nNote that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. (emphasis mine)\nSince our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the \"right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms. he is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one.\nReason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:\nJosh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that \"The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement. This latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration.\" As reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them. (Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.) While the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files\u2014which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do\u2014the distribution is already happening.

Ever since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it. Every one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve. God made that clear when He told Adam that \u201cin what day soever\u201d he preferred his own will above his Creator\u2019s, \u201cthou shalt die the death,\u201d condemning him sooner or later to \u201creturn to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return\u201d (Gen. 3:19). In other words, there has always been a death penalty. God instituted it, and He was the first to impose it, embedding it in the very fabric of natural law.\nWhen Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel \u201cin the field,\u201d he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone. Cain is told, \u201cWhat hast thou done? The voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth to me from the earth,\u201d and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor. When Cain complains that being a \u201cvagabond . . . on the earth, every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me,\u201d God laid down that \u201cwhoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold,\u201d setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others. The Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God\u2019s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions.\nAlthough men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked \"that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\" they did so as murderers, outside God's law without legal right. Only after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause. He told Noah, \u201cFor I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man. Whosoever shall shed man\u2019s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.\u201d In other words, from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God.\nAfter the great theophany on Sinai, Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion, which in strict justice required \u201clife for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:21). The supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch. Idolatry, fortune-telling, acting as a medium, preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death, as was blasphemy, an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified, \u201cHe that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger\u201d (Lev. 24:16). Death was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court.\nA priest\u2019s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev. 21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment. Everyone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: \u201cThe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee\u201d (Deut. 17:7). The Law read, \u201cDefile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another\u201d (Num. 35:33).\nIn order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut. 20:1-9). After all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that \u201cman was made to the image of God\u201d that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God. It is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due. This point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said:\nA penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction. Order violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium . . . . A word must be said on the full meaning of penalty. Most of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law. In those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty . . . . In the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being. If it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.\nToday the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder. Despite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself, growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral. John Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever. But doesn\u2019t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice? In the U.S., following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man-centered conciliar religion, the faithful are beginning to equate abortion, nuclear war and capital punishment as common \u201cthreats to the sacredness of human life\u201d without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved. If they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic \u201ctradition which comes from the Apostles\u201d actually \u201cdevelops in the Church\u201d and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).\nThe circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty, which the new man-centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God\u2019s. At the same time, there is more and more discussion about society\u2019s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place, together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless, guilty \u201cvengeance\u201d on them. The idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.\nAccording to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical. What proof of this can possibly be offered? How can we know? Deterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty. To a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, \u201cThey shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother. . . that others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things. Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut. 19:19-21). And the Preacher notes that when \u201csentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear\u201d (Eccles. 8:11).\nTo illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church, a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying:\nThe death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma. Therefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is, immoral heretics. To approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent. Those who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems. Those, however, who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge. Please consider that in anger and tragedy, the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question \u201cmust this person\u2019s life be taken to preserve society?\u201d The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment, nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society. I do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied. Thus to call for a moratorium . . . is not unjust or incorrect.\nThat the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument. Given the fallen human condition, such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system, and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied. What is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against. Considering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him. That the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether. The supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed, but treated as non-existent.\nThis first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago. Isn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?\nThe source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace. According to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed. In 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed. In the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place. At its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century. At this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare. Many nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether. Whether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.\nWhat leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance. It is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom, when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven. In modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives. It is only to be expected that materialists\u2014for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has\u2014should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him. In their eyes this means total extinction, a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty.\nNot even God completely obliterates a human existence, not even for the most odious sins, for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal. (It might be argued, however, that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim, why not do the same to him?) In the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose. Justice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit. Nor was the idea of \u201crehabilitation\u201d with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned. It has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.\nAs it is, the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense. When Catholic society puts a man to death, it terminates only his temporal life on earth, catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God. Suffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society, but if accepted in Christ\u2019s grace with due repentance, it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory. If his contrition is perfect, it\u2019s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven! In any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.\nAs Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d\u2019Ailleurs for September-October 1983, \u201cThe truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view.\u201d That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that, in the order of charity, atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man, and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well-being. Modern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being, whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse. In the context of the faith, the importance of a man\u2019s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven.\n+++\nAs we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history. Dating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God\u2019s name, it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days. One might expect that after the Incarnation, when God became man and replaced the Old Testament\u2019s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace, the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded. Converts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its \u201cNew Pentecost\u201d would in fact argue in this wise, perhaps citing the Council\u2019s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that, \u201cThanks to the experience of past ages ...the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened,\u201d and the world now has \u201ca keener awareness of human dignity\u201d ( 44, 73).\nFar from obliterating the death penalty, however, the Incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance, hidden from the beginning. As the new dispensation\u2019s foremost theologian, St. Paul would declare, the old penalty remained very much in force: \u201cAlmost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.\u201d It is still \u201cappointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment\u201d (Heb. 9: 22,27), but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven. This possibility is owed, furthermore, to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised, unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent Man who was God, in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined. When God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures. The Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation.\nNot even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him. It would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth, with only one significant change: Henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is Christ the King, as part and parcel of that universal power \u201cin heaven and on earth\u201d which He received from His Father (Matt. 28:18) after His Resurrection. From that point on it is Christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing, and both Scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom He entrusts the temporal sword in His Kingdom. As He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, \u201cThou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above\u201d (John 19:10).\nPope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that \u201ctrue and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all. The Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.\u201d Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate. As St. Paul said:\nTherefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation. For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. . . For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is the minister of God: and avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil (Rom. 13:2-4).\nSufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of Adam could ever commit, the execution of the Man-God nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death. It continues to be the wages of sin (Rom 6:23), and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives, either willingly or unwillingly. A share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord\u2019s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects. These were allowed to remain as restraints on men who, now raised to a new supernatural existence, were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore. As for the death penalty, it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil.\nWhat Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe. As St. Paul declared, \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?. . . For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead. And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive\u201d (1 Cor. 15: 54-55; 21-22). The first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to \u201cFollow me!\u201d Inviting all to Calvary to \u201csuffer under Pontius Pilate\u201d with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing \u201cthe mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints\u201d to all who, like St. Paul, would \u201cnow rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church. . .\u201d (Col. 1:26, 24).\nCriminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us. As with everyone else the moment of death ushers them either into heaven, hell or purgatory. The most that can be said is that their lives here on earth are shortened, and they must settle their accounts sooner than expected. This could be a great mercy for them as well as for society, both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated. The death penalty, from the first one imposed on man by God in the beginning in Eden, to the one imposed on God by man on that Good Friday in Jerusalem, on down to those still being imposed today, transcends human legislation. By divine decree it will perdure until the end of time, when \u201cthe former things are passed away.\u201d Only then \u201cdeath shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more,\u201d and not one minute sooner.

Recently the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian. But they raised it in a way that didn\u2019t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens. These people listened to the more powerful governments. In Washington they met Mr. Pompeo, who refused to discuss Assange altogether. I think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks. I think that is very, very likely.\nAs I understand Julian, this is something he would not even contemplate. But that might be one of the so-called \u201cwretched deals\u201d that are being offered Assange. Some very strange things are being said by senior members of these two governments. The new foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, Jeremy Hunt, said sarcastically that the British police would offer Julian \u201ca warm welcome\u201d when he came out, when he would face serious charges. There are no serious charges. He hasn\u2019t been charged with anything. Special Ed: Voices fro... Dennis Bernstein Best Price: $2.49 Buy New $5.00 (as of 06:30 EDT - Details)\nWas Hunt referring to a deal which has already been done with the United States on extradition? I don\u2019t know. But this is the milieu of machination around someone who has the right of natural justice concerning his freedom. Putting aside freedom of speech, the persecution of this man has been something that should horrify all free-thinking people. If it doesn\u2019t horrify us, then we have surrendered something very valuable.\nDB: Among those who should be especially horrified are those of us in the journalistic community. John, I would like you to explain once again why Julian Assange is such a significant journalist, why so many journalistic institutions have collaborated with him based on the information he provided. We are talking about a publisher and reporter who has changed history.\nJP: Nothing in my time as a journalist has equaled the rise of WikiLeaks and its extraordinary impact on journalism. It is probably the only journalistic organization that has a 100% record of accuracy and authenticity! All of WikiLeaks\u2019 revelations have been authentic. And it has been done \u201cwithout fear or favor.\u201d Although there has been a concentration on, say, the release of the Hillary Clinton/Podesta emails, or the Iraq and Afghan war logs, WikiLeaks has released information that people have a right to know across the spectrum. It has released something like 800,000 documents from Russia, and now WikiLeaks is accused of being an agent of Russia!\nWikiLeaks\u2019 journalism has covered a universal space and that is the first time this has happened. In Tunisia, the release of WikiLeaks documents foretold the Arab Spring. The people at the forefront of the uprising in Tunisia credit WikiLeaks for informing them of what their repressive government was doing behind their backs. In Venezuela, WikiLeaks released cables which described in great detail how the United States intended to subvert the government of Hugo Chavez. Some of this was published in the mainstream media, when there was still a collaboration with WikiLeaks.\nThe Clinton/Podesta emails, which appear to have made a number of people resentful, were published in the New York Times. These emails showed the close role that Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation played in support of extreme jihadism in the Middle East. That was a very important piece of information for people to know and understand. By doing that, WikiLeaks performed an extraordinary public service, while at the same time making some very serious enemies.\nRandy Credico: People sometimes forget that, apart from being a journalist, Julian Assange is a human being. You have known him a long time. Could you give us a feel for the kind of person Julian Assange is?\nJP: Julian is a very principled individual. He feels very strongly about the moral basis of WikiLeaks. When he first put up WikiLeaks, he wrote that the whole idea of transparency, honoring people\u2019s right to know, was the central aim of the website. He feels that very strongly. Any attempt to do a deal with Julian to shut down WikiLeaks will no doubt be resisted. As a person, Julian is an extremely interesting man. He is very well read. He studied physics. He has a very good sense of humor, and I have often laughed out loud with him about situations that others might consider too bleak to discuss. His black humor is a part of his survival kit. Obviously, he is incredibly resilient. Personally, I could never endure what he has, especially in recent years. But this comes with a cost and his health is continuing to deteriorate. Those close to him are extremely worried. Cypherpunks: Freedom a... Julian Assange Best Price: $3.04 Buy New $9.55 (as of 06:45 EDT - Details)\nIn a letter to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Julian\u2019s father, John Shipton, wrote: \u201cI ask the prime minister to do all within his power to return Julian home before Julian\u2019s situation becomes an irreversible tragedy.\u201d That is why this is such an urgent case of justice toward a single human being as well as a case of a journalistic organization\u2019s right to function and our right to have the information it provides. Only seven years ago, the current prime minister said that when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way the prime minister should respond. That was Turnbull before he became prime minister. Now the government is playing its usual role of being the fifty-first state of the United States. It is a true disgrace.\nRC: What about Theresa May and the British government? Are they getting pressure from the United States or are there internal reasons why they want to keep Julian Assange quiet?\nJP: Everything comes down to the relationship with the United States. Australia has an almost totally servile relationship with America, in which its national security structure, much of its academic life and certainly much of its media is integrated into the US system. That is not entirely the case in Britain. Since the loss of its empire after the Second World War, Britain has been eager to play a secondary role to the new imperial power. In many parts of the world, Britain is still the biggest corporate investor. But it does move in lockstep with the US on much of its foreign policy. It is interesting to see the corruption that this kind of relationship produces. Information has come out that the Crown Prosecution Service tried to prevent the Swedes from giving up the case against Julian on bogus sexual assault charges. The pressure was on from London to keep it going.\nJulian is also seen as defying a system and that is just not acceptable. There is a real element of vindictiveness here. The Crown Prosecution Service kept this case going when otherwise the European warrant put out by the Swedes would have been abandoned in 2013. When Julian came up to a bail hearing last year, it was an absolute disgrace. The judge described Julian\u2019s circumstances as if he were on some sort of extended vacation. What didn\u2019t emerge was the whole conflict of interest in this hearing. The judge\u2019s husband is a figure deep within the national security establishment in Britain who was named in WikiLeaks documents. Because there is no serious media examining the whole WikiLeaks witch hunt, virtually none of this emerges.\nDB: The corporate press has a major responsibility if Julian Assange goes down, don\u2019t you agree?\nJP: As you know, Dennis, governments do respond to pressure from powerful media interests. It rarely happens but when it does governments do change their tune. There has been no pressure from media in the United States, Britain, Australia or pretty much anywhere except in programs like yours outside the mainstream. You are absolutely right in that the responsibility of journalists for what has happened to Julian Assange and what might happen to WikiLeaks is undeniable.\nI was looking this morning at a report by Media Lens in Britain describing how the British press has reported on Julian Assange. It describes the tsunami of vindictive personal abuse that has been heaped upon Julian from well-known journalists, many claiming liberal credentials. The Guardian, which used to consider itself the most enlightened newspaper in the country, has probably been the worst. The frontal attacks have been coming not from governments but from journalists. I described this recently as \u201cVichy journalism,\u201d a term which now fits so much of the mainstream media. It collaborates in the same way that the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis.\nThe WikiLeaks Files: T... WikiLeaks Best Price: $2.75 Buy New $7.00 (as of 12:00 EDT - Details) There used to be spaces within the so-called mainstream for unbiased discussion, for the airing of real grievances and injustices. These spaces have closed completely. The attacks on Julian Assange illustrate what has happened to the so-called free media in the West. I have been a journalist for a very long time and I have always worked within the mainstream, but the journalism I see now is part of a rapacious establishment and one of its prime targets is Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. This is precisely because WikiLeaks is producing the kind of journalism that they ought to be doing. WikiLeaks has in fact shamed journalists, which might help to explain the deeply personal abuse he has suffered. WikiLeaks has revealed what journalists should have revealed a long time ago.\nDB: Even the attorney for the New York Times happened to mention that if Julian Assange gets prosecuted, the Times could get prosecuted under the same laws.\nJP: It could but I don\u2019t believe it would be, because power respects power. The New York Times is part of the establishment. The difference with WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent.\nDB: What would be your strongest plea for Julian Assange?\nJP: It\u2019s very simple. This is about justice. In a famous speech given in the 1930\u2019s by Parson Martin Niemoller, he said that first the Nazis came for socialists, but he didn\u2019t speak up because that didn\u2019t concern him. Then they came for trade unionists, but he didn\u2019t speak up because that didn\u2019t concern him. He didn\u2019t speak up when they came for the Jews because he wasn\u2019t a Jew. And, of course, finally they came for him. That might not be a precise parallel, but if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us. It means that we have kept quiet. Keeping quiet has allowed the great atrocities of histories to take place. If Julian is allowed to be spirited away to some super-max hellhole, it will be a great atrocity.\nDB: In the library, silence is golden. In the world of human rights, silence equals mass murder. They say you shouldn\u2019t yell fire in a crowded theater just to get a reaction. But if you know the theater is in fact on fire and you do not shout out, what happens after is your responsibility.\nReprinted with permission from Consortiumnews.com.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Red_Herring", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Grandfather & NY Imam Confirms Remains At New Mexico Compound Were Missing Boy\nA New York mosque imam claims that after speaking with family members, the remains found earlier this week a New Mexico compound where children were being held by Muslims and trained to engage in mass school shootings, are those of his grandson.\nAbdul-ghani Wahhaj, would have turned 4 Monday.

To make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless \u201cpromoted\u201d to become the archbishop in our nation\u2019s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.\nWhile I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there\u2019s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think that the Church in the United States will rest \u2014 and confidence will be restored \u2014 until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn\u2019t happen again.\nThe matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here. It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.\nA number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him. I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York. What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers. When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press). By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.\nIt would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick. Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read \u2014 as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer \u2014 an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers. While the complaint didn\u2019t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that \u201cArchbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.\u201d The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation. Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.\nI can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him. I heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick. With St. John Paul II\u2019s 1995 visit, he was remembered for \u201cbringing a saint to Newark,\u201d not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.\nWhen I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew. I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.\nWhile the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there\u2019s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese. The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege. I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.\nOur heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that \u201cwhere sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.\u201d May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.\nREMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called \"gay lifestyle,\" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime.\nFar from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an \"inclusive community\" that \"welcomes all\" and \"judges none.\" All very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance. In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:\nHomosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\" They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)\nUnder no circumstances\u2026except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.\nEven Pope John Paul \"The GREAT's\" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the \u201cLetter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\u201d:\nAlthough the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder. Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option. It is not.\nNotice the late pope does not say, \u201cLet the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,\u201d as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.\nDoes Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs? Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics? Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our \"Catholic Christian\" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?\nPope John Paul certainly didn't accept that. In his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an \u201cideology of evil,\u201d insisting of so-called 'gay marriage' that:\n\u201cIt is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.\u201d\nWas Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe? Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?\nOr is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration? And if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception. We're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.\nSo why are our bishops playing dumb? Quite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly. This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about! But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of \"accompaniment\" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.\nSo what's going on here? Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?\nIs it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the \"gay lifestyle\" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance? The Catholic Church's new-found \"climate of tolerance\" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!\nIt is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground. This is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.\nAgain, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it\u2019s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that\u2019s going on here. Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness. And neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our \u201cmost enlightened\u201d age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.\nUntil the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy. McCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Conversation_Killer", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Imam Whose Son Was Training School Shooters Blasts Reporters On New Mexico Compound: \u201cThey Hate Islam\u201d\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that AP would carry this story at all; certainly, neither AP nor the rest of the establishment media is ever so solicitous of those whom they smear as \u201canti-Muslim\u201d to allow us to tell our side of the story.

Legal challenges by clergy delayed the report\u2019s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights. Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.\nThe report\u2019s release begins an information war, with prosecutors and many victims saying it\u2019s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time, while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century, unfairly smearing today\u2019s Catholicism in Pennsylvania.\nThe report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston. But recent abuse-related scandals, from Chile to Australia, have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels.\nThe new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis\u2019s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility. The pope\u2019s track record has been mixed, something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change-averse institution.\nThe Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades. Both have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power. It has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a long-term struggle not only about the meaning of justice, but about the meaning of memory,\u201d said Jason Berry, a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades. \u201cAnd how honest the church has been about this crisis. Most bishops, besides apologies, have not been on the cutting edge of change.\u201d\nChurch officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report. On Monday, D.C.\u2019s archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former longtime leader of the Pittsburgh diocese, warned his priests in a letter that the probe will be \u201cprofoundly disturbing.\u201d\nREMNANT COMMENT: The report also shows that \u201cmore than 90 \u2018offenders\u2019 will be listed\u201d in Donald Cardinal Wuerl\u2019s former diocese, which is ironic since Wuerl is one of Pope Francis\u2019s closest U.S. advisers and sits on the Vatican\u2019s bishop oversight committee. Well played, Cardinal Wuerl!\nSo, let me get this straight (I know, lots of luck with that one): These are the people that are going to \"accompany us\" and our children in the \"synodal Church\" with its new orientation, overseen by a \"God of Surprises\" who is uber-merciful and doesn't judge, and headed up by a pope who, according to Father Thomas Rosica, \"breaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants, because he is 'free from disordered attachments'?''\nYou don't say!\nAll this and rampant homosexuality in the priesthood, too... along with a \"trivialized liturgy\" (according to Pope Benedict XVI) and widespread apostasy among the faithful?

In so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes. They will be crucified in the media, yes. But they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church\u2019s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within. Nothing less will do. Bishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news. May God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino. MJM\nBishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church\nAugust 18, 2018\nDear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,\nThe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals. Still more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.\nFor my part \u2014 and I know I am not alone \u2014 I am tired of this. I am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt! I am tired of the obfuscation of truth. I am tired of sin. And, as one who has tried \u2014 despite my many imperfections \u2014 to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.\nThe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening. Hearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick. But my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years. For them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities. To them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.\nIf you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal. Also, if you\u2019ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.\nThere is nothing about these stories that is okay. These actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.\nFaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair. And why? The reality of sin \u2014 even sin in the Church \u2014 is nothing new. We are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity. So what is new? What is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others. Unless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the \u201cwages of sin.\u201d\nFor too long we have diminished the reality of sin \u2014 we have refused to call a sin a sin \u2014 and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy. In our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.\nWhy do we do this? Is it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being \u201cpastoral?\u201d Have we covered over the truth out of fear? Are we afraid of being disliked by people in this world? Or are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?\nPerhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this. In the end, the excuses do not matter. We must be done with sin. It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable. Love sinners? Yes. Accept true repentance? Yes. But do not say sin is okay. And do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.\nFor the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come. The deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church. There is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.\nIf you\u2019ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred! As I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity. As the Book of Proverbs says \u201cMy mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov. 8:7).\u201d It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\nThere must be no room left, no refuge for sin \u2014 either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities. To be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled. In this I speak of all sin. But to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual \u2014 almost exclusively homosexual \u2014 acts by clerics. We\u2019re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals. We are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all. To call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia. That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia \u2014 this despite clear evidence to the contrary. It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more. To fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable \u2014 neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one\u2019s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick\u2019s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power. The well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord. The Church\u2019s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest. And the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable. Such wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred. Christian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness. But while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense. In fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come. Motivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians. The result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ\u2019s name. It causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds \u2014 which is the very definition of scandal. And the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this. However, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God. No matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God\u2019s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective. Here now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese. This is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve. We must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement. If you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources. If you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don\u2019t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector. I will address it swiftly and vigorously. I will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation. I trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day. You are called to serve Christ\u2019s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours. This is to keep you very close to God. In addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop. In obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest \u2014 as Christ Himself is calling you to do. And by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve. God will give you the graces to do so. Ask Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day. And if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me. I will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward. It will be addressed quickly and justly. If you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well. Such actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person. Again, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood. Failure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well. I promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to pray. Pray earnestly for the Church and all her ministers. Pray for our seminarians. And pray for yourselves and your families. We must all work daily on our own personal holiness and hold ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy. I will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes. In addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same. Some sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil. We must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness. We must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors \u2014 myself included \u2014 that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness. We must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and \u201chouse cleaning\u201d of this type of depravity. I stand with them. I don\u2019t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally. But I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: \u201cAs for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.\u201d\nFaithfully yours in the Lord,\nMost Rev.

The laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests.\nHere is the dirty secret that is now emerging. Many in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church\u2019s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality. The personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed, recruited, and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle. Many priests, bishops, and cardinals practiced what Francis preached, \u2018who am I to judge.\u2019\nThe result? A litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics.\nThis is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church. The upcoming Synod and its embrace of the \u201cLGBT\u201d lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades-old scandal.\nBe forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16-29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth, many of whom think homosexuality is cool. And the Bishops know it.\nThe full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover. Until it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation.\nThe warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth.\nAccording to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an \u201cexpression of the Church\u2019s pastoral concern for the young,\u201d and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis\u2019s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia.\nWe\u2019ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics. Francis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups.

Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is \u201clooking for trouble.\u201d\nTrump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is \u201cDisgraced and discredited,\u201d claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a \u201cgroup of Angry Democrat Thugs.\u201d\nThat came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a \u201cgang.\u201d Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base.\nThe president\u2019s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day.\nTrump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president\u2019s personal attorney.\nBut Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for \u201cover 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.\u201d (The tweet included a misspelling of \u201ccounsel.\u201d)\nThe length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is \u201clooking for trouble\u201d because they \u201cthey know there is no Russian Collusion.\u201d\nBut Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting.\nAs Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer.\nThe president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a \u201cphony crime.\u201d He\u2019s right, there is no specific collusion statute. But legal experts say anyone in Trump\u2019s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice.

We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,\u201d Francis said.\n\u201cLooking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient. Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,\u201d he added.\nColm O\u2019Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors\u2019 group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered \u201cMuch stronger language than ever used before.\u201d\nBut O\u2019Gorman added: \u201c(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.\u201d\nLike his predecessor, Francis has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world \u2014 including in Australia recently.\nIn January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no \u201cproof\u201d against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.\nFollowing an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims\u2019 claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations.\nAccording to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.\n\u201cSixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn\u2019t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else\u2019s crimes,\u201d Allen said in a Sunday column.\n\u2014 Alvise Armellini\ndpa\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92018 Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n", ["Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump\nPersonal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump: You\u2019re wrong, Mr. President.\nSessions long has been one of Trump\u2019s favorite pinatas, often taking the brunt of the president\u2019s public scorn. Trump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: \u201cWhat kind of man is this?\u201d\nTrump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator \u201cnever took control of the Justice Department.\u201d\nAbout seven hours later, the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer fired back.

That line of criticism has been picked up by, among others, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who was indicted on federal officials this week on charges of misusing campaign finance funds for personal use.\nTrump did not directly answer a Fox News interviewer\u2019s question about whether he intends to fire Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the special counsel investigation, after November\u2019s congressional elections.\nHe also said he only gave the former senator the job because Sessions was a supporter during the 2016 presidential race.\n\u2014 John T.

It is the response of the military/security complex to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign statement that he intended to normalize relations with Russia.\nTrump recognized that the extreme Russiaphobia, which the hegemonic neoconservatives had whipped up since Vladimir Putin\u2019s statement at the Munich Security Conference in 2007 that Russia was a sovereign country and intended to act like one, was a threat to life on earth. The neoconservatives, who have controlled US foreign policy since the Clinton regime, are unwilling to accept limitations by any other country on Washington\u2019s ability to act unilaterally.\nWhen Putin blocked the Obama regime\u2019s invasion of Syria and bombing of Iran, the neoconservatives paid Putin back by using NGOs and Ukranian politicians financed by Washington to overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine and to put in office a government hostile to Russia. The intent was to use Ukraine, a Russian province for more than three centuries, to create problems for Russia that would absorb Russia\u2019s attention and return a free hand to Washington and Israel in the Middle East and also to evict Russia from its Black Sea naval base in Crimea. When Crimeans voted to reunite with Russia, Washington misrepresented the democratic result of self-determination as a \u201cRussian invasion and annexation of Crimea.\u201d Such an extraordinary misrepresentation destroyed any remaining confidence the Russian government might have had in Washington\u2019s veracity.\nThe Neoconservative Th...

As I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments.\nDonald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia.\nThe problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently. After 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force. President Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail. From the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the \u201cRussian threat\u201d that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys. Only 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion. The military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military.\nObama\u2019s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump. Comey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election. Based on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump.\nAfter two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people. Indeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen. He pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort.\nMueller\u2019s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line. Manafort\u2019s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller\u2019s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate. Manafort\u2019s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as \u201cA dark day for Trump,\u201d with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office.\nManafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application.\nWe do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller\u2019s frameup and an incompetent jury. American juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain. Even the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury. Remember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI\u2019s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI.\nIt is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages. Instead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.\nIncome tax invasion is the purview of the IRS, not of a special prosecutor who is supposed to be looking for evidence of a Trump-Putin conspiracy.

Let Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:\n\u201cAll the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject.\n\u201cThe witness may not only be \u201csinging,\u201d he may also be \u201ccomposing\u201d \u2014 that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal.\n\u201cUnder federal law, the testimony of such a \u201cflipped witness\u201d need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction.\n\u201cEven one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.\u201d\nPresident Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury.\nKnowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump.\nThis tactic is used every day by state, local, and federal prosecutors. Americans who believe the indictments and convictions are unaware that 97% of the time the convictions rest on self-incrimination in order to avoid worse punishment.\nIn Manafort\u2019s case it didn\u2019t, or hasn\u2019t, worked. Yet. Manafort is due for a second trial, this time for allegely acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and for making false statements not under oath to the US government. Reportedly, Manafort is being held in solitary confinement, a form of torture designed to break a person\u2019s spirit.\nLike Manafort\u2019s first trial, his second trial has nothing whatsoever to do with Russiagate, but you will never learn that from the presstitute media or from the Democratic Party. Manafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.\nWhat about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump? Mueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute. Therefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation.\nCohen avoided a jury and said he was guilty of five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in order to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions. With regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements. He said that on Trump\u2019s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump.\nThe intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear. Apparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money. Why a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi-billionaire doesn\u2019t make much sense.\nBut these are not the kind of questions that the presstitutes are interested in.\nNevertheless, Cohen\u2019s plea is associated with a case brought by another prosecutor, not by Special Prosecutor Mueller. I am not sufficiently familiar with US legal procedures to be able to say how this gets brought back into Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nThe facts are this:\nThe US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia. Period. At some point Putin and Lavrov and the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will have to acknowledge this fact, or Russia will be destroyed.\nTrump, by declaring normalization of relations as one of his two principal goals for his presidency, earned the emnity of the powerful military/security complex. By defeating Hillary for the presidency, Trump inflamed the US media\u2019s hatred, committed as the presstitutes are to Identity Politics and hatred of the \u201cwhite male oppressors\u201d who elected Trump. Trump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who \u201cgrabs women by the pussy.\u201d\nThe hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media.

He could fight, not with words on Twitter, but with the powers of the presidency. There is far more evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States than there is evidence that it is a Trump-Putin conspiracy to steal the election from Hillary. If Mueller can indict on the basis of no evidence, Trump can order the Attorney General to indict on the basis of massive evidence that Russiagate is a conspiracy against the President of the United States.\nBrennan, Comey, Clapper, Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe, Strzok, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, the New York Times, Washington Post, et. al., are all members of the conspiracy to overthrow democracy in America and establish the undisputed rule of the military/security complex.\nThe idiot presstitutes\u2019 hatred of Trump might leave them unaware of the conspiracy in which they are participating, but there is no doubt that the American presstitutes are engaged in the overthrow of American democracy, however little of American democracy still exists.\nThis column is not an endorsement of Trump.

This is not a unique happening of the Trump presidency. It began under VP Dick Cheney, the real president during the 8 years of the George W. Bush regime. Cheney turned the environmental protection regulatory agencies over to industry polluters.\nTrump is wrong on Iran. He is in Israel\u2019s hands, hoping that the power of the Israel Lobby can shield him from the presstitutes and the military/security complex. What Israel is doing by attempting to use US military force against Iran is unifying a new alliance that is too powerful for the Washington/Israeli alliance. Russia, China, Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, and Pakistan are the locations of populations that massively outnumber Washington\u2019s empire. Each of these countries are being united by Washington\u2019s stupid and inexplicable actions against each.\nMilitarily, Israel is of no consequence. Twice the vaunted Israeli Army, capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children, were defeated and driven out of southern Lebanon by a few thousand Hezbollah militia. Israel is too cowardly to try it a third time, and is relying on the stupid Americans to do the job for them.\nThe entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see? Two countries, both the result of exterminating the native populations, distrusted and universally hated, both of which survive by purhasing the governments of other countries and by endless lies that describe everyone but themselves and their vassals as evil criminals that must be destroyed.\nFor example, the Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world, is being systematically destroyed along with all life within it by Israel under cover of the obvious and transparanent lie that all within Gaza are terrorists outfitted with bomb belts who are committed to the destruction of Israel. Not only men of fighting age, but also old men, pregnant women, children, all Palestinians are being murdered by the Israeli military. The United States Secretary of State agrees with Israel that all Palestinians must be destroyed, the sooner the better.\nThe Chinese are busy taking advantage of the financial opportunities that the idiot Americans forfeit, but otherwise do not seem to have any strategic sense of how to proceed in the drama unfolding in front of their eyes. For China, money is now all.\nThe Russians are infected with the American propaganda infused into their veins during the Yeltsin era when Russia was an American puppet state. Slowly, if not surely, the Russians are coming to their senses and realizing that they have no American \u201cpartner.\u201d\nIf Trump is defeated and moved off the table, what happens when Russia and China finally realize that there is to be no conciliation with Washington? When all the false hopes and bets of the Russian and Chinese governments of conciliation on the basis of mutual economic interests come to naught, what happens?\nIt will be the end of life on earth.\nThe Russiagate \u201cinvestigation\u201d appears to be timed to influence the midterm elections with unsubstantiated accusations made just before the elections in an attempt to produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach President Trump on false charges.

For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake. And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.

Lot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house. The angels agreed. The Bible then informs us, \"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom \u2014 both young and old \u2014 surrounded the house. They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. Genesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver. Lot and his family flee the city, and then \"the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah \u2014 from the LORD out of the heavens. Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities...\" (Genesis 19:2 4) .\nIn light of the passage, the most common response to the question, \"What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?\" is that it was homosexuality. That is how the term \u201dsodomy\u201d came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced. Clearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities. The men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels, who were disguised as men. At the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.\nEzekiel 16:49-50 declares, \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me...\" The Hebrew word translated \"detestable\" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an \"abomination.\" Similarly, Jude 7 declares, \"...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.\" So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.\nThose who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality. The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable. There is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape. But to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.\nWhile Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants. To this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland. Sodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.\nThe point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it.\nQuestion: How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities (Jonah 2:4) and refuse to return to the Lord (Jeremiah 6:16) on His terms? (Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.\nMen today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth. They are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).\nThey care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).\nMen today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through \u201cantinomianism\u201d than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).\nInstead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.\nThey care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares (Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord (Luke 16:15).\nThey wear the cross. Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: \u201cDeny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me\u201d (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).\nProfessed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18). They read what to do, but do it not! In fact, they declare and proclaim how much they love God, and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives, they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions (Matthew 15:8).\nThen again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out \"Crucify him! Crucify him! We have no king but Caesar\" (John 19:15). And these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).\nThey continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4). Today, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times. They declare we're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord's commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).\nUngrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are (Matthew 23:3).\nInstead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here. Instead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states, they teach them to just do their best to understand that they cannot help themselves while God say\u2019s the opposite (Leviticus 20:18).\nInstead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them, they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down.\nAnd instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies (Proverbs 6:17), they merely pass it off as a \"choice,\" that being the lessons that they learned from the media that they say that they do not believe (Romans 1:18).\nThe American Church, instead of protesting corruption in government through the example of the Biblical patriarchs and our American forefathers (Matthew 5:17-18), teach to submit to tyranny as if to suggest that it is somehow obedience to God (Romans 12:21).\nThe Church in America has failed to keep the Commandments of the God of Israel.\nInstead of preaching out against sin, they advocate for that which God clearly condemns, thereby making war against God (Micah 3:5), which at length destroys our government, our country and our families.\nLook to their feigned strength that they profess to possess. It is gauged by simply looking to the prevailing immoralities and debauchers of society. They are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today!\nWhy did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah? It's the same reason that he is judging America today (Amos 4:12), He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her (Jeremiah 22:3).\nDefining the Wicked\u2026\nWicked men in the sight of God are those who have the knowledge of what to do when it comes to the right, but over and over again, they turn their shoulders and choose the wrong, through tolerance and apathy Americans are bringing upon themselves destruction (Deuteronomy 30:19) that will not be reversed, which leaves no alternative as to why God judges and is judging America today (Deuteronomy 28:63).\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Trump expresses sympathy for Reality Winner, whose mom asks for pardon\nATLANTA \u2014 The record-setting prison sentence given to Reality Winner has caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who used it to take another dig at Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nIn an early Friday post on Twitter, Trump wrote that her sentence of 63 months in federal prison was unfair and accused Sessions of having a double standard.\n\u201cGee, this is \u2018small potatoes\u2019 compared to what Hillary Clinton did!\u201d he tweeted about Winner, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked a document about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cSo unfair Jeff, Double Standard.\u201d\nThe tweet drew no immediate response from Sessions.

Right and wrong? Maybe. But good and evil have a supernatural ring we usually reserve for dramatic and abominable crimes, like genocide. Yet everything right is good, and everything wrong is evil. The evils we encounter in our day-to-day lives might not be a spectacle, like jihadists beheading a journalist on live television. All the same, evil is part of ordinary life. It dwells deep in our hearts \u2013 each and every one of us.\nThe Prince of this World has made a grand display of his authority in the last few centuries. Our saving grace is that, while Westerners no longer believe in God, they still believe in the Devil. We\u2019re at least clear-eyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world, even if we can no longer see the great Good hidden behind the veil.\nThis is the point about the McCarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook. How was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to? And how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place, let alone promoted to Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington?\nThe answer is, ultimately, demonic. As Catholics, we ask St. Michael to \u201ccast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.\u201d McCarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible, not only for their sexual abuses, but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood.\nSpend enough time in Catholic World and you inevitably meet good men who quit the seminary because of some rampant (and often violent) depravity. What could suit the Devil more than to watch the Church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff?\nThe gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church, as Our Lord promised. But they won\u2019t stop trying, either. They\u2019ve attacked from the front, sending the Roman pagans, French Revolutionaries, and British American secularists. They flank us by sending heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung. Today, there\u2019s also a fifth column working to tear down the walls from within \u2013 not only pedophiles like John Geoghan, but also predators like Theodore McCarrick.\nWhere did those fifth columnists enter? Why, there\u2019s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council.\nAggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur. The idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to \u201cbring itself up to date\u201d is ridiculous.\nYet that was precisely the aim. As St Pope John XXIII explained, \u201cIts principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.\u201d It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570.\nThe goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution.\nNow, I don\u2019t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition. I share Pope Paul IV\u2019s view. When he heard that the Council was being convened, then-Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed, \u201cThis holy old boy doesn\u2019t realise what a hornet\u2019s nest he\u2019s stirring up.\u201d\nNonetheless, he stirred it. The spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s \u2013 and the seminaries especially. Seminarians called for a more \u201cparticipatory\u201d administration. They became involved in socialist politics.\nThey formed trade unions to demand the right to marry. They practiced sauvage intercommunion.\nOf course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well. Perhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the \u201cpriest-worker movement\u201d who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council. During a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: \u201cthe great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life\u201d that occurred in his city in May of 1968. \u201cOne also felt that, in these events of May,\u201d Marty continued, \u201cthe seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.\u201d Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries. As the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly \u201cout of step\u201d and in need of \u201cmodernizing\u201d. Inevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality.\nBishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of \u201can ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.\u201d\nBut that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se. Rather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men \u2013 given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries. This began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church\u2019s teachings on chastity and celibacy.\nNeedless to say, not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick. But the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to \u201cseduce\u201d his victims.\nMany have also speculated that, because McCarrick\u2019s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn\u2019t consider them newsworthy. If he\u2019d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing. Pedophile priests sell papers. But taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed? Running that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man: an act the liberal press would no doubt consider \u201chomophobic\u201d, as Ross Douthat pointed out.\nMeanwhile, those bishops who didn\u2019t approve of his actions knew the culture \u2013 both within the Church and without her \u2013 were against them. The post-Vatican Church doesn\u2019t like to come off as a nag.\nShe\u2019s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because\u2026 what? It\u2019s immoral? That\u2019s not very aggiornamentistic! The world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind. And even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren\u2019t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice.\nWe seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church\u2019s problems would be solved if we\u2019d just go back to the Latin Mass. Something went critically wrong during Vatican II that extends well beyond the Mass. And we can\u2019t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of \u201cLefebvrism\u201d and say so.\nThose who love our Holy Mother \u2013 those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites \u2013 mustn\u2019t be deceived into thinking this is a small or an isolated issue. It isn\u2019t. This is the crisis of an ancient and immortal institution trying desperately to seem young and fashionable; like all old men, it only manages to come across as lecherous and pathetic. Its obsession with \u201cmodernization\u201d leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity. Instead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man.\nI don\u2019t know what it will take to set things right. I don\u2019t know what it will take to exorcise the \u201cspirit of Vatican II\u201d \u2013 the spirit of aggiornamento \u2013 from the Church. But we will. Christ promised.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States Accuses Pope of McCarrick Cover-up, Calls on Francis to Resign\nIn this tragic moment for the Church in various parts of the world \u2014 the United States, Chile, Honduras, Australia, etc. \u2014 bishops have a very grave responsibility. I am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs. The Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life.\nAlso, as this is an unprecedented moment in papal history, perhaps the unprecedented step of recalling Benedict XVI to the Chair of St. Peter should also be considered sooner rather than later, before this crisis gets any more out-of-control than it already is. May God save His Church MJM\nSo serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign. But before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water. He and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.\nArchbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's \"kingmaker\" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals.\nRemnant Editor's Note: This could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis. The former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse. This is a charge most serious, perhaps without precedent in modern times.\nBishops and priests, abusing their authority, have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful, minors, innocent victims, and young men eager to offer their lives to the Church, or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated.\nTo restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ, which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes, and if we truly want to free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen, we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden. We must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful, a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect, a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia. \u201cWhatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops\u201d (Lk. 12:3).\nI had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself. That is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia. But now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church\u2019s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016.\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.) and the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State.\nTo dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles, I will immediately say that the Apostolic Nuncios in the United States, Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi, both prematurely deceased, did not fail to inform the Holy See immediately, as soon as they learned of Archbishop McCarrick\u2019s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests. Indeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.\u2019s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo. In the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the \u201980s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop \u201cshared his bed with seminarians,\u201d inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house. And he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.\nThe office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State.\nLikewise, Nuncio Sambi transmitted to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone, an Indictment Memorandum against McCarrick by the priest Gregory Littleton of the diocese of Charlotte, who was reduced to the lay state for a violation of minors, together with two documents from the same Littleton, in which he recounted his tragic story of sexual abuse by the then-Archbishop of Newark and several other priests and seminarians. The Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public. He therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.\nIn writing up a memo[1] on these documents that were entrusted to me, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, on December 6, 2006, I wrote to my superiors, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone and the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, that the facts attributed to McCarrick by Littleton were of such gravity and vileness as to provoke bewilderment, a sense of disgust, deep sorrow and bitterness in the reader, and that they constituted the crimes of seducing, requesting depraved acts of seminarians and priests, repeatedly and simultaneously with several people, derision of a young seminarian who tried to resist the Archbishop\u2019s seductions in the presence of two other priests, absolution of the accomplices in these depraved acts, sacrilegious celebration of the Eucharist with the same priests after committing such acts.\nIn my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:\n- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,\n- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can. 1405 \u00a7 1, No. 2\u02da, \u201cipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi\u201d;\n- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church.\nI added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press. This could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors. If this were done, the civil authority would no longer have to judge a cardinal, but a pastor with whom the Church had already taken appropriate measures to prevent the cardinal from abusing his authority and continuing to destroy innocent victims.\nMy memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter.\nSubsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com. On April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone. It was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008.\nThe following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006. In it, I summarized Richard Sipe\u2019s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: \u201cI approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time. The problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome. If Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.\u201d\nI ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal\u2019s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state.\nThis second memo of mine was also never returned to the Personnel Office, and I was greatly dismayed at my superiors for the inconceivable absence of any measure against the Cardinal, and for the continuing lack of any communication with me since my first memo in December 2006.\nBut finally I learned with certainty, through Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, that Richard Sipe\u2019s courageous and meritorious Statement had had the desired result. Pope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\nI do not know when Pope Benedict took these measures against McCarrick, whether in 2009 or 2010, because in the meantime I had been transferred to the Governorate of Vatican City State, just as I do not know who was responsible for this incredible delay. I certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies. I believe it was due to the Pope\u2019s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope.\nIn any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi. Monsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires a.i. after the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington \u2014 and he is ready to testify to it\u2014 about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature. Monsignor Lantheaume told me that \u201cthe Nuncio\u2019s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.\u201d\nPope Benedict\u2019s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio.\nIn turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature. The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\nThe faithful insistently wonder how it was possible for him to be appointed to Washington, and as Cardinal, and they have every right to know who knew, and who covered up his grave misdeeds. It is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia.\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him. In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end. He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up. Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed. Benedict reacted, despite Sodano\u2019s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\nWas McCarrick\u2019s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill? We are not given to know. However, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this. McCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia. If Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn\u2019t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions. His nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re. At the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington.\nNuncio Sambi\u2019s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State. My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute. As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals \u2014 I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians \u2014 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict.\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents. In April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick\u2019s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less. As Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid. \u00c7a va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!\nThe same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation. They were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.\nCardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.\nNor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know. As Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State.\nAs far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. Cardinals Edwin Frederick O\u2019Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology. Others belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\nNow to the United States. Obviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick\u2019s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.\nIt is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it. In any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn\u2019t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it. I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick. I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it. If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable. The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion. Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters. Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written. The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it. However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did. I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years. But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope\u2019s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C. In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.\nBishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims. They cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn\u2019t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick. Given his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him. I don\u2019t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel\u2019s crimes. If he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?\nRegarding Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, I would simply say that his latest statements on the McCarrick case are disconcerting, and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility.\n* * *\nMy conscience requires me also to reveal facts that I have experienced personally, concerning Pope Francis, that have a dramatic significance, which as Bishop, sharing the collegial responsibility of all the bishops for the universal Church, do not allow me to remain silent, and that I state here, ready to reaffirm them under oath by calling on God as my witness.\nIn the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions. The date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013. Pope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor. Of course I also came to Rome from Washington. It was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.\nOn the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there. As soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock. I greeted him respectfully as I had always done. He immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: \u201cThe Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.\u201d\nAt the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter. Nor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave. Therefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.\nThe next day the audience with Pope Francis took place. After his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one. In single file, I remember that I was among the last. When it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, \u201cI am the Nuncio to the United States.\u201d He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: \u201cThe Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized! They must be shepherds!\u201dOf course I was not in a position to ask for explanations about the meaning of his words and the aggressive way in which he had upbraided me. I had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O\u2019Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me \u201cso he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.\u201d I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.\nAt the end of the audience the Pope announced: \u201cThose of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\u201d I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.\nOn Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week. How could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me? At the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: \u201cThe Pope told me to ask if you are free now!\u201d Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope\u2019s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately. The Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: \u201cWe have 40 minutes before the Angelus.\u201d\nI began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday. And the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: \u201cYes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing \u2014 and he added, raising both arms \u2014 and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.\u201d Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.\nImmediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naivet\u00e9: \u201cHoly Father, I don\u2019t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject. But then, what was the Pope\u2019s purpose in asking me that question: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.\nBack in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis. When the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics. When he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: \u201cthe Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds\u2026.\u201d I was astounded! It was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick. Also the Pope\u2019s mention \u201cnot like the Archbishop of Philadelphia\u201d could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians. In his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion. Indeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.\nNot happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Cardinal Donald Wuerl. He asked me: \u201cWhat is Cardinal Wuerl like, is he good or bad?\u201d I replied, \u201cHoly Father, I will not tell you if he is good or bad, but I will tell you two facts.\u201d They are the ones I have already mentioned above, which concern Wuerl\u2019s pastoral carelessness regarding the aberrant deviations at Georgetown University and the invitation by the Archdiocese of Washington to young aspirants to the priesthood to a meeting with McCarrick! Once again the Pope did not show any reaction.\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis\u2019s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews. In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration. This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal. With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops. In addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari \u2014 the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio \u2014 as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary. Something unprecedented for such an important position!\nThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two. Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\nRegarding Cupich, one cannot fail to note his ostentatious arrogance, and the insolence with which he denies the evidence that is now obvious to all: that 80% of the abuses found were committed against young adults by homosexuals who were in a relationship of authority over their victims.\nDuring the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water. Perhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine. Extolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism. In support of this thesis, Cupich \u201coddly\u201d made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he \u201ccandidly\u201d ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male. In fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that \u201cin most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.\u201d\nThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: \u201cReserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.\u201d McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick\u2019s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\nThese characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs. We need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O\u2019Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O\u2019Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States. It should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits.\nFather James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus.\nPope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia. The faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner. He must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests.\nIn any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him. He did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.\nThe latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope\u2019s protection that he can dismiss as \u201cgossip\u201d the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary.\nBy now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga\u2019s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See.\nIn the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan Jos\u00e9 Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L\u2019Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: \u201cIt was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to \u2018clear\u2019 his name after being subjected to much slander.\u201d Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\nIn the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public.\nFinally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga. From 2003 to 2007 Pe\u00f1a Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature. As Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.\nIn Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated. The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops. First he insulted the abuse victims. Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\nEven in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis\u2019s behavior was no different. He knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator. Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick\u2019s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church. It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media.\nNow in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick\u2019s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign.\nBut this will not be enough to heal the situation of extremely grave immoral behavior by the clergy: bishops and priests. A time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed. The virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries. Corruption in the misuse of the Church\u2019s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against. The seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced. The homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote. \u201cThe problem of clergy abuse,\u201d she wrote, \u201ccannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives. The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.\u201d These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\nI implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.\nLet us heed the most powerful message that St. John Paul II left us as an inheritance:Do not be afraid! Do not be afraid!\nIn his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father\u2019s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ\u2019s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God\u2019s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men. The Church, the depositary of the blessing of the New Covenant, signed in the blood of the Lamb, is holy but made up of sinners, as Saint Ambrose wrote: the Church is \u201cimmaculata ex maculatis,\u201d she is holy and spotless even though, in her earthly journey, she is made up of men stained with sin.\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church\u2019s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies. At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: \u201cEveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ... If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it. We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.\u201d If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church\u2019s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt. He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick. And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!\nFrancis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren. Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock.\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them.\nEven in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope! We well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication.\nIt is in moments of great trial that the Lord\u2019s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives. This is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins, to convert, and to do penance.\nLet us all pray for the Church and for the Pope, let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him!\nLet us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: \u201cI believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!\u201d\nChrist will never abandon His Church! He generated her in His Blood and continually revives her with His Spirit!\nMary, Mother of the Church, pray for us!\nMary, Virgin and Queen, Mother of the King of glory, pray for us!\nRome, August 22, 2018\nQueenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nOfficial translation by Diane Montagna.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Horrifying Details Released: 2 Jihadi Muslims At Deadly NM Islamic Compound Hit With New Charges\nSiraj Ibn Wahhaj and one of his devout wives were charged with abuse of a child resulting in the death of a child and conspiracy to commit abuse of a child.\nLaw enforcement rushed to destroy the Islamic compound just days after the kidnapping and murder made national news.

The word khalifa means \u201csuccessor\u201d; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims. As I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the \u201cRightly Guided Caliphs\u201d to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.\nThese weren\u2019t the actions of a \u201ctiny minority of extremists,\u201d abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for \u201chijacking\u201d their religion. This was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time. The History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law. And so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.\nWhat is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain. As the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them. While it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.\nSo it is today. Islamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one. There is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other jihad terror groups.\nMeanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest. Western authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully. Instead, if they have taken any notice of him at all, which is unlikely, they have dismissed him as an \u201cextremist.\u201d\nThey have yet to come to grips with the fact that \u201cextremism\u201d is and always has been so distressingly widespread in Muslim communities. But they will.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Federal judge rules against Trump administration on 3-D gun blueprint case\n(This article by McClatchy-Tribune contains fake news, which we refute at the end. \u2013BL)\nA federal judge on Monday issued a preliminary injunction continuing a prohibition on the Trump administration proposal to make available blueprints for so-called ghost guns, untraceable weapons that can be manufactured on a 3D printer, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.\nCalifornia was one of 20 states led by Washington that won the decision from U.S. District Judge Robert S.

Faggioli\u2019s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.\nRegarding Bergoglio, Vigan\u00f2 testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick\u2019s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses). Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit. All of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally\u2014only weeks ago\u2014took decisive action against his \u201ctrusted counselor.\u201d McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio\u2019s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported \u201csame-sex marriage,\u201d and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990. As Edward Pentin notes: \u201call 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.\u201d\nVigan\u00f2 concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church. As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church\u2019s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies. At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: \u201cEveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ... If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it. We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.\u201d [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church\u2019s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt. He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick. And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church! [my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren. Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock. In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them. [emphasis in original]\nBefore he was papal nuncio in Washington, Vigan\u00f2 headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia. In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.\nWith Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again. Even before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation. Yet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous \u201creforms\u201d that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century. Those \u201creforms\u201d included abandonment of the Vatican\u2019s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that \u201cadvancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.\u201d Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.\nKill the Messenger\nI suspect that not even Vigan\u00f2\u2019s historic testimony will change the neo-Catholic position. Quite the contrary, I would expect the neo-Catholic commentariat either to ignore Vigan\u00f2\u2019s witness, explain away his revelations or, failing that, make every effort to smear the man.\nThe campaign to discredit Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing. Only hours after Vigan\u00f2\u2019s sworn testimony appeared online, the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters, writing for National Catholic Reporter, smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law, as \u201ca trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact, fiction and venom,\u201d \u201cmore than a little obsessed with homosexuality\u201d\u2014like Oliver Stone, who \u201cwas obsessed with the grassy knoll\u201d\u2014\u201ca disgruntled former employee\u201d and \u201calways a crackpot.\u201d Without addressing the merits, Winters dismissed Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s \u201cwild claims\u201d about bishops who are \u201csubverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality\u201d and accused the Archbishop, along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops, of \u201cspeak[ing] about gay people with such hatred\u2026\u201d\nWinters issues the dire warning that \u201cA putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not, as a body, stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours, we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops\u2019 meeting in November. The enemies of Francis have declared war.\u201d Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies, but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity.\nJohn Allen\u2019s instant analysis attempting to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier. His opinion is: \u201cTake it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.\u201d Which is just Allen\u2019s more nuanced way of saying: \u201cDon\u2019t believe it.\u201d Allen\u2019s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account implicates \u201cno fewer than 32 senior churchmen\u201d (so what?), that he \u201chas a history\u201d of \u201cinnuendo and conspiracy theories\u201d (a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity), that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed (an allegation Vigan\u00f2 has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents, but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy) and that Allen has \u201cthe impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind\u201d (the same \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d mentality he gratuitously attributes to Vigan\u00f2).\nMark Shea, easily the most insufferable of the neo-Catholic polemicists, has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s claims. Ignoring eleven pages of detail, written and published under oath, he suggests there has been no \u201cDocumentation. Evidence. Proof.\u201d Yes, Francis should resign if Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s allegations are true, Shea admits\u2014a stunning concession coming from him. Yet, making no attempt to refute Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account on the merits, he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument\u2014puerile mockery: \u201cBut at present, the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor, not against it.\u201d Shea\u2019s ever-expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack: Well, if those people believe it, it can\u2019t be true.\nThe neo-Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness, however. Speaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that \u201cVigan\u00f2 said the truth. That\u2019s all,\u201d when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict\u2014sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage.\nFurthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Vigan\u00f2\u2019s character and credibility:\n- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations credible.\n- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona, issued a statement affirming that he has known Vigan\u00f2 for 39 years, has \u201calways known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity\u201d and that his testimony should \u201cbe taken seriously by all\u2026\u201d\n- Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit, Michigan issued a statement calling Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account \u201canother daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the Church\u2019s leadership, during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity.\u201d (The statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website.)\n- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: \u201cArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God. There is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2.\u201d\n- Cardinal Raymond Burke\u2019s statement declares: \u201cThe declarations made by a prelate of the authority of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the Church.\u201d\n- [And just two days ago, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which \"speaks to Vigano's integrity and sincere love of the Church.\"]\nIn another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Vigan\u00f2 himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict\u2019s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because, as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms, at Vigan\u00f2\u2019s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio\u2019s election. The Herald asks the obvious question: \u201c[I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions, and unaware of the reason for them, why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand?\u201d The question answers itself, and Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl\u2019s own spokesman.\nBergoglio Pleads the Fifth\nBergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony. During the return flight from Dublin after the \u201cWorld Meeting of Familes,\u201d he was asked to comment on Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick\u2019s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict. Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself:\nRead the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment. I am not going to say a word about this. I believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions. It is an act of trust. When a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work. It will do you all good, really.\nIn other words, as Bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying, he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away\u2014with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea, who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio\u2019s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him \u201cseems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless\u2026\u201d. Seems to be. Obviously.\nThe American \u201cGay\u201d Church Expansion\nWhile events have overtaken Faggioli\u2019s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic. That polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival. But before I address Faggioli\u2019s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony.\nFirst of all, as I predicted 16 years ago, because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre-conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary \u201ca new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed\u2014and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church.\u201d That prediction came immediately after the \u201cpedophile summit\u201d of 2002 in Rome, which I attended as The Remnant\u2019s correspondent. In answer to my question then head of the USCCB, Wilton Gregory, made an explosive admission reportedby the international press: \u201cit is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.\u201d The struggle, to the extent there even was one, obviously has been lost.\nSixteen years later, the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world, stripped of his cardinal\u2019s hat and deprived of any ministry, but only after international media coverage of the Vatican\u2019s semi-secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago. If not for that one case, McCarrick\u2019s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ, including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio.\nThe telling details of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony concerning Bergoglio\u2019s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose\u2014details conveniently ignored by Winters, Allen and Shea\u2014are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio. This would explain why he will not a \u201csay a word about\u201d Vigan\u00f2\u2019s charges against him.\nThe Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he \u201cwas to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Vigan\u00f2 himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:\nI repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature. The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\nVigan\u00f2 testifies that on June 23, 2013, he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope\u2019s residence three days earlier, during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph: \u201cThe Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China\u201d (evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio\u2019s planned sellout of China\u2019s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing). Vigan\u00f2 wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions. During the audience Bergoglio queried: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d and Vigan\u00f2 replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:\nI answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naivet\u00e9: \u201cHoly Father, I don\u2019t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him. He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject. But then, what was the Pope\u2019s purpose in asking me that question: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not\u2026. It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis\u2019s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews\u2026. He [Bergoglio] knew from at least June 23, 2013 [the date of the audience with Vigan\u00f2] that McCarrick was a serial predator. Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick\u2019s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church. It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media. [all emphasis in original]\nBefore his long overdue fall McCarrick, as Bergoglio\u2019s \u201ctrusted counselor,\u201d had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual-friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful. It was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin. And Vigan\u00f2 now confirms Tosatti\u2019s allegation: \u201cThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two. Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\u201d That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.\nRemnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002, when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo: accelerated degeneration. As I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:\nCupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop. He is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure\u2026. Let the thing die of its own excesses, for as the \u201clittle synod\u201d [the 2002 \u201cpedophile summit\u201d] demonstrates, the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant, uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II. For heaven\u2019s sake, the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked. From the Vatican on down, through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect, the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy, the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching, the Church\u2019s militant opposition to worldly thinking, the traditional formation in seminaries, the religious orders, the missions, the trust of the faithful in their own priests\u2014in short, the very life of the Church\u2014and dare to call it a renewal. We must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin. Nor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling fa\u00e7ade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.\nAs for William (\u201cnighty-night baby!\u201d) Tobin, after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark, Tobin, another episcopal booster of Martin\u2019s pro-homosexual propaganda, promptly sponsored a \u201cgay pilgrimage\u201d to his cathedral in Newark. And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal\u2019s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop. Farrell, yet another promoter of Martin\u2019s homosexual activism, arranged for Martin to \u201cwelcome \u2018gay\u2019 families\u201d at the \u201cWorld Meeting of Families\u201d in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned.\nFinally, there is the appointment of the \u201cpro-gay\u201d Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego, concerning which Vigan\u00f2 reveals: \u201cThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: \u2018Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.\u2019 McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick\u2019s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\u201d Like Cupich, Tobin and Farrell, McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin\u2019s homosexual subversion of the Church, calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a \u201ccancer of vilification [that] is seeping into the institutional life of the church.\u201d\nEmboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever, Martin, now backed by \u201cCupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy,\u201d as Vigan\u00f2 testifies, is urging all the \u201cgay priests\u201d to \u201ccome out,\u201d including those ordained since the useless \u201cpedophile summit\u201d presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house.\nBut Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin\u2019s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church. As Vigan\u00f2 notes, it was Bergoglio who made Martin a \u201cConsultor of the Secretariat for Communications,\u201d even though he is a \u201cwell-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFather\u201d Martin now confidently declares, sixteen years after the \u201cpedophile summit,\u201d that \u201cThe idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous. Any purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.\u201d\nMartin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors, who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network, and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it.\nA Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top\nNone of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests. The spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals. This is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio, who made a flagrantly active homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, \u201cprelate of the gay lobby,\u201d no less than head of his papal household.\nMoreover, it was Bergoglio\u2019s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan Jos\u00e9 Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese. When an apostolic visitation, compelled by mounting public pressure, confirmed the charges against Pineda, he was forced to resign, even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as \u201cslander.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 notes that \u201cthe only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\u201d\nDespite the fall of his friend Pineda, Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary, involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss, rejecting all the evidence as \u201cgossip.\u201d Concerning Maradiaga, who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation, Vigan\u00f2 provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio:\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration. This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal. With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops\u2026.. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga\u2019s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See\u2026. The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops. First, he insulted the abuse victims. Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\nOn the very day Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony was made public, Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy, to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily: \u201cFrom the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals, homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.\u201d\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 now provides his own decisive summary of the situation, based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church:\nJanet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote: \u201cThe problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives. The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.\u201d These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church. [emphasis added]\nDefending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo\nAt this moment, the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption, and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s call for Bergoglio\u2019s resignation, including Laura Ingraham: \u201cToo little, too late from Pope Francis in Ireland. I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano. Time for the laity to demand a new Shepherd.\u201d Even Michael Voris, in a highly amusing example of leading from behind, has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline: \u201cPope Francis Must Resign.\u201d\nNearly three years ago, seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established, this newspaper published a petition which states: \u201cWe your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls. Failing this, would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church\u2019s integrity?\u201d Our petition was of course dismissed as \u201cridiculous\u201d by the neo-Catholic commentariat. Today, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.\nFrom the neo-Catholic perspective, the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect: the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment, an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition, which growing numbers of young people are seeking. Hence even before Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 had come forward, commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo-Catholic air raid siren. Faggioli fretted that \u201c[t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church\u201d that could be filled by the \u201cneo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics\u201d who \u201cattack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis.\u201d Accordingly, he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against \u201ca radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense...\u201d\nFor Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio\u2019s resignation be unthinkable, so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled. The Pope, he argues, is not \u201cthe CEO of the Catholic Church world, and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire.\u201d No, Bergoglio cannot \u201csimply fire\u201d bishops. Except whenever he pleases, as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals (Burke and M\u00fcller) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends, prompting even Crux to ask: \u201cDoes Pope Francis have an enemies list?\u201d Then again, Francis even obtained the removal of his own \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d McCarrick from the College of Cardinals, albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media.\nSo, according to Faggioli, the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media, is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene \u201cgay culture\u201d in the Church and replace them with orthodox, normal heterosexual males. Francis cannot \u201csimply fire\u201d even Cardinal Wuerl, who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh, and who authorized payment of $900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography.\nWuerl, says Faggioli, \u201cfaces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry\u2026 while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases\u2026 It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol\u2026 beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.\u201d\nIn other words, because his situation is \u201ccomplex\u201d Wuerl, unlike McCarrick, should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington, DC, thus maintaining a key bulwark against the \u201cneo-traditionalist\u201d threat. Yet, as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents, Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it. Here too Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony sheds light on the darkness:\n\u2026. I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn\u2019t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it. I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick. I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it. If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained? His recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable. The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well. Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion. Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters. Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written. The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it. However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did. I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years. But the Cardinal knew nothing about it! Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope\u2019s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C. In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk. [emphasis in original]\nWhat really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his \u201ccomplex situation,\u201d which is not complex at all. Rather, what he views with alarm as an \u201cessential element\u201d of the context in which Wuerl operates is that \u201cscandals are also the opportunity for the neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis\u2026.\u201d Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption, financed by the faithful, than a single, young neo-traditionalist prelate!\nBut what exactly is a neo-traditionalist? Quite simply: an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual-infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council, Bergoglio merely being the latest, the highest placed, and one of the last. As Faggioli puts it: \u201cIn the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals. They interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council\u2026\u201d\nJust as Faggioli fears, many in the up-and-coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious: that the conciliar texts, for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching, opened the way to ecclesial disaster. Because in those texts\u2014above all Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae, Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium\u2014the Council verbally prostrated itself before \u201cthe modern world\u201d and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini (Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis. To quote Paul VI, then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council\u2019s close:\nBut one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one. Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic. A wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity\u2026. Instead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world. The modern world\u2019s values were not only respected but honored, its efforts approved, its aspirations purified and blessed. [emphasis added]\nThus did Paul describe the conciliar \u201copening to the world\u201d through which the world promptly invaded the Church, including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary.\nIn sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: \u201cThis neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy\u2026 and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.\u201d\nRather than \u201cyoung clergy marked by personal sanctity,\u201d the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the \u201cdialogue with modern culture.\u201d It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty. Any abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason\u2014\u201cCatholic Jacobinism\u201d\u2014if not criminal activity. Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of \u201cCatholic Jacobins\u201d for \u201chate speech\u201d than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.\n\u201cHomosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed,\u201d Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece, \u201cbut the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots, well before Vatican Council II.\u201d And how does the Church \u201caddress\u201d a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation? Faggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing\u2014the final beachhead of the neo-Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime\u2014is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a \u201cneo-traditionalist\u201d storm surge.\nFaggioli\u2019s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a \u201cmodern world\u201d founded precisely on a rejection of the Church\u2019s authority. It is not about the Faith at all. Rather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department. For people like Faggioli, indeed for the tradition-hating Pope they blindly defend, the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo-Catholic polemic for what it is\u2014a fraud\u2014and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church. That is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.\nIn this respect, what the neo-Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves\u2014that is, the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see, to their horror, that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable, indeed apocalyptic, level.\nA return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young. Irony of ironies, he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration, led largely by a youthful vanguard, of what is ever ancient but ever new. For some, it seems, no price is too great\u2014not even the good of the Church\u2014to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.\nConclusion: The Fatima Connection\nLong before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment. As to Bertone and Sodano, Vigan\u00f2 provides further vital testimony:\nNuncio Sambi\u2019s report [on McCarrick\u2019s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State. My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute. As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals \u2014 I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians \u2014 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict\u2026. Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him. In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick. It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end. He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up. Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed. Benedict reacted, despite Sodano\u2019s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\nIt is no coincidence that, as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima, Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety, stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong. Concerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Vigan\u00f2\u2019s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Vigan\u00f2\u2019 credits with diligently reporting McCarrick\u2019s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict\u2019s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:\nWe were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed. Sambi said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know this book? You should read it.\u201d It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden. \u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are the Pope\u2019s representative in the US, and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote?\u201d Sambi replied, \u201cAll I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book. And in the end, we are all after the truth, aren\u2019t we? The truth is the important thing...\u201d\nThe truth is indeed the important thing. And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:\nAs for the new things which we can find in this message today, there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without, but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church, from the sin existing within the Church. This too is something that we have always known, but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way: that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church, and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance, to accept purification, to learn forgiveness on the one hand, but also the need for justice. [emphasis added]\nI believe that Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the \u201cneed for justice\u201d in the Church. Whether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history, the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church\u2019s restoration. This will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists, such as Faggioli, who, in typical neo-Catholic style, imperiously scoffs at the notion of \u201ca young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages\u201d and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as \u201ca Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.\u201d\nI can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2:\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Appeal_to_Popularity", "Repetition", "Conversation_Killer", "Straw_Man", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Obfuscation-Vagueness-Confusion"]], ["FBI Arrests 5 Muslims From New Mexico Jihad Compound Days After Multiple Charges Were Dropped\nJust days after a district judge dropped all charges against three of the Muslim jihadis at the New Mexico terror compound where a child was killed and 11 other children were being trained to commit jihad in mass school shootings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped up to arrest five Islamists, but the charges are no longer the same.\nRemember, this all occurred because the district attorney failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn\u2019t even bother to show up for court.\nCBN reports:\ntake our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

(AP) - Federal prosecutors say the FBI has arrested five former residents of a ramshackle compound in New Mexico on firearms and conspiracy charges as local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy at the property. Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office will now seek grand jury indictments involving the death. Gallegos said seeking indictments will allow more time to gather evidence. All five people will remain in custody pending a Tuesday hearing in federal court. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Albuquerque said compound resident Jany Leveille has been charged with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition. She is a Haitian national. The other four members are charged with conspiring with Leveille.\nAnd the death of the three-year-old? Nothing!\nAnd what of the training of little jihadis? Nothing!\n\u201cThe defendants, Jany Leveille, 35, a Haitian national illegally present in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, Hujrah Wahhaj, 37, Subhanah Wahhaj, 35, and Lucas Morton, 40, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico,\u201d the bureau said in a statement.\n\u201cThe criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of New Mexico from Nov. 2017 through Aug. 2018,\u201d the bureau said. \u201cThe criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.\u201d\nYet, in the midst of all of this, don't forget that the FBI ignore the intelligence that was provided to them, just like they have in many cases, which, if they had acted, they may have saved the little boy's life.\nIn the meantime, the New Mexico district attorney who failed to file for a preliminary hearing within 10 days and didn\u2019t show up for court is vowing to pursue prosecution of these jihadis.\n\u201cThe actions yesterday by the district judges do not affect our continuing efforts to prosecute the individuals as charged originally,\u201d Eighth Judicial District Attorney Donald Gallegos said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWhile we disagree with the judges, they did their jobs. We will continue to do ours.\n\u201cGoing forward, our options are to refile the charges or take the cases to the grand jury. We are assessing and will decide which avenue to pursue.

Cussing and threatening the people involved will not accomplish justice and serves no useful purpose. Remember, you do not have all the facts. That will develop as the cases progress.\"\nYeah, well, that's about as trustworthy as the FBI in this matter.\nThis latest move, while welcome, may only be a response to President Donald Trump's vow to \"get involved.\"\nHowever, I ask, why were you not involved in the first place, Mr. President? According to the Constitution, you, and you alone, are the sole head of the executive branch, and as such you are where the buck stop in making sure the laws are faithfully executed.\nSo, if Trump is going to fire Sessions, perhaps he should stop talking about it and get to it and actually put someone in the Justice Department as attorney general who will do the job faithfully, and by that, I don't mean Trey Gowdy. I mean someone who is serious about justice, not political grandstanding or covering up criminal activity.\nUntil then, I'll consider this the means the FBI will use to engage in the further coverup of what really took place at that compound beyond the bulldozing of a crime scene, and possibly, their own complicity.\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Doubt", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Repetition"]], ["FBI: Muslim Teen From NM Islamic Compound Trained For Jihad: \"Raise An Army\" \"Killing Non-Believers On Behalf Of Allah\"\nIt was a jihad training camp.

By Andrew Hay, Reuters, September 2, 2018: The boy was among 11 children and five adults living at the compound in Taos County when it was raided on Aug. 3 by local sheriff\u2019s deputies who discovered a cache of firearms and the children living without food or clean water. The dead body of a three-year-old boy was found buried at the site later They initially faced state charges, then on Friday, the five adults including a Haitian woman described as the group\u2019s leader, 35-year-old Jany Leveille, were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and accused of conspiracy and firearms offenses. In an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, an FBI special agent wrote that Leveille\u2019s 13-year-old son told investigators that his mother\u2019s boyfriend, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, wanted to \u201cget an army together\u201d and train them for jihad. The boy told agents that Ibn Wahhaj trained him and another of Leveille\u2019s teenage sons in firearms and military techniques, including rapid reloads and hand-to-hand combat, and told them jihad meant killing non-believers on behalf of Allah, according to the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in New Mexico. The 13-year-old also told the FBI that his mother believed she received messages from God, and that he watched her and Ibn Wahhaj perform supposed \u201cexorcism\u201d rituals over the three-year-old boy, including one during which the boy choked and his heart stopped, according to the special agent\u2019s affidavit. The teenager said his mother and others at the compound told him not to talk to anyone about the three-year-old ever being at the compound because they would \u201call go to jail.\u201d Defense lawyers have said that the five adults were exercising their constitutional rights to practice their religion and own firearms, and that the group is being discriminated against because they are black and Muslim. The defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. The five defendants came under FBI surveillance in May after Leveille wrote a letter to Ibn Wahhaj\u2019s brother asking him to join them and become a \u201cmartyr,\u201d state prosecutors have said.

We are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov\u2019s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, \"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\". Having written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad. Frontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-\u00e0-vis our enemy.\nWe find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 approaching tomorrow:\n*\n9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\nBy Jamie Glazov\nWhile the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement \u201cstrategies\u201d that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America\u2019s favor.\nBelow are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:\n1. Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.\nThe Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war. It is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e. Islamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e. Islamic law).\n2. Scrap \u201cCountering Violent Extremism.\u201d\n\u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war. On the one hand, this \u201cfocus\u201d is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us. On the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of \u201cextremists\u201d \u2014 who just happen to be the Left\u2019s political opponents \u2014 that pose a great threat to the country.\nFor example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the \u201cviolent extremists\u201d the administration is clearly worried about are the \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.\nThe \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.\n3. Stop \u201cPartnering\u201d With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.\nThe government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately. The Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood\u2019s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups. Moreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.\n4. Implement a Concrete \u201cCountering-Jihad\u201d Strategy.\nAfter discarding the \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy. It must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.\nMost importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual \u201cthreat doctrine analysis\u201d in a thorough document, just like George Kennan\u2019s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War. It is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war \u2014 and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.\n5. Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.\nThe Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7. What does our propaganda war entail? Zilch.\nSebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts \u2013 which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.\nConsequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions. These programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers. This has to also involve, as Gorka urges, \u201ca nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.\u201d\nThe education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka\u2019s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists\u2019 hands.\n6. Affirm Sharia\u2019s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.\nOnce the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e. remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI). Indeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.\n7. Put Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.\nAuthorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance \u2014 and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is \u201cracist\u201d and Islamophobic to do so. Islamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it. As Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists\u2019 understanding of Islam \u2014 and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government. (This will be a part of Gorka\u2019s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).\nSpencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the \u201ctrust\u201d of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.\n8. Bring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.\nInstead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S. Homeland Security Advisory Council (he \u201cresigned\u201d in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it. We all know who these noble and courageous individuals are \u2013 and some of them are referenced in this article. The government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.\n(P.S. Yes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad. But the debate over this belongs in another forum. And whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)\n9. Ridicule the Enemy.\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon. There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture\u2019s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives\u2019 eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit. American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so \u2013 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.\nWe must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world. Indeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia\u2019s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.\nJamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History with a specialty in Russian, U.S. and Canadian foreign policy.

This investigation is ongoing and we will release additional details as they become available and it is appropriate to do so.\nI have no idea how you can enter an apartment mistakenly. Does Guyger leave her door unlocked? Furthermore, The Dallas News reports:\nJean, who lived on the fourth floor of the South Side Flats in the Cedars, was home alone when Guyger mistook his apartment for hers, the affidavit says. Guyger lived on the third floor, directly beneath his apartment, and mistakenly parked on the fourth floor after finishing a shift at the Dallas Police Department, the affidavit says. When she arrived at Jean's door, Guyger entered a unique door key with an electronic chip into the keyhole, the affidavit says. The door was already ajar, so the force of pushing the key inside opened the door, according to the affidavit. The affidavit says the apartments' \"respective interior floorplans are in most ways identical or extremely similar.\"\nThe apartment was dark and when she saw \"a large silhouette,\" Guyger thought she was being burglarized, the affidavit says. The affidavit says Guyger drew her gun, \"gave verbal commands that were ignored\" and fired twice. Jean was struck once in the torso. Guyger then called 911 from her cellphone and started performing first aid. She turned on the lights, then went to the front door again and realized the apartment wasn't hers, the affidavit says. She told the 911 operator as well as responding officers that she thought she was at her apartment when she shot Jean, according to the affidavit. Ok, some of this seems plausible, but I still am left wondering about the door being ajar. Is this something people are prone to do at 1o o'clock at night in Dallas?\nIn any case, we all know that any of us who did the same thing would have immediately been taken into custody. This was not the case with Guyger, though one officer close to her said, \"she is devastated.\"\nKnowing this provoked outrage across the nation over the weekend.\nIn fact, this is not her first shooting.\nAs a four-year veteran of the force, she was also involved in the shooting of another suspect in 2017.\nThe Dallas News reported:\nIn 2017, Guyger shot 47-year-old Uvaldo Perez, who had wrestled a Taser away from her. Another officer had been in a Pleasant Grove neighborhood looking for a woman who had a warrant out for her arrest. When the officer thought he saw the woman in a car with two men in the 8300 block of Reva Street, the officer asked for backup from Guyger and another officer, according to an affidavit. One of the officers was trying to search Perez when he became combative, the affidavit said. Guyger deployed her Taser before Perez was able to take it from her. After Perez had the Taser, Guyger fired her gun once, striking him in the abdomen, the affidavit said. Neither Guyger nor the other officers were injured in the 2017 shooting. Police arrested Perez on a charge of taking a weapon from an officer, as well as charges for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and violating his parole. In February 2018, Perez signed a plea agreement for the charge of taking an officer's weapon and was sentenced to two years in prison.\nThe Texas Rangers are also involved in the investigation.\nUSA Today reports that Guyger was freed on bail on Sunday after being charged with manslaughter, and faces two 20-year sentences and up to a $10,000 fine. A charge of murder may be forthcoming once the case is taken to a grand jury, according to Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.\n", ["Repetition"]], ["Google colluded with Clinton campaign with \u2018silent donations\u2019\nWhile the establishment continues to push the notion that a couple hundred thousand dollars of ad spends and some Russian bots on Facebook swayed the election to Donald Trump, more proof of real \u201ccollusion\u201d between Google and the Hillary Clinton campaign has been uncovered. And Google likely violated federal election laws \u2014 not to mention the privacy of its users \u2014 in the services it provided the Clinton campaign.\nFox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson read an internal email on Monday night\u2019s show that outlined in a Google\u2019 executive\u2019s own words how the company was providing a \u201csilent donation\u201d to a group that was creating ads and donating funds to bus Latinos to voting stations in key swing states. The email was sent by Eliana Murillo, the former head of Google\u2019s multicultural marketing department.\nThe email was forwarded to Google vice presidents and other staff members throughout the company, Carlson said.\nAccording to Carlson:\nIn her email, Mario touts Google\u2019s multi-faceted efforts to boost Hispanic turnout in the election. She noticed that Latino voters did record-breaking numbers, especially in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona \u2014 the last of which she describes as \u201ca key state for us.\u201d She brags that the company used its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.\u201d\nMurillo also brags that Google, \u201cused its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.\u201d Unfortunately for Clinton and Google, as Murillo lamented, \u201c\u2026ultimately after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us. We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump. No one did.\u201d\nThe assistance Google provided to the Clinton campaign likely violated election laws and served as an unreported in-kind contribution.\nOf course, anyone who paid attention was aware of Google\u2019s attempts to interfere on Clinton\u2019s behalf. WikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House.\nEmails obtained by WikiLeaks showed correspondence between Schmidt and Clinton, along with a number of Clinton operatives discussing strategy meetings and campaign ideas. Among the strategies was the creation of a voter tracking database using smart phones.\nA report by a research team earlier this year found that Google can manipulate opinions of undecided voters by inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate.\nMeanwhile, Trump took to Twitter early Tuesday morning to note the Department of Justice\u2019s inaction over the fact that disgraced anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress were engaged in a \u201cmedia leak strategy\u201d to plant negative stories which were then used to secure FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign.\nNew Strzok-Page texts reveal \u201cMedia Leak Strategy.\u201d @FoxNews So terrible, and NOTHING is being done at DOJ or FBI \u2013 but the world is watching, and they get it completely. \u2014 Donald J.

She noticed that Latino voters did record-breaking numbers, especially in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 the last of which she describes as \u201ca key state for us.\u201d She brags that the company used its power to ensure that millions of people saw certain hashtags and social media impressions, with the goal of influencing their behavior during the election.\u201d\nElsewhere in the email Mario says \u201cGoogle supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states .\u201d Hillary the Other Woman Dolly Kyle Best Price: $3.06 Buy New $8.93 (as of 01:15 EDT - Details) She describes this assistance as a \u201csilent donation\u201d Mario then says that Google helped Voto Latino create ad campaigns to promote those rides. Now officially Voto Latino is a non-partisan entity, but that is a sham. Voto Latino is vocally partisan. Recently the group declared that Hispanics \u2013 ALL Hispanics are in President Trump\u2019s \u201ccrosshairs.\u201d They said they plan to respond to this by registering another million additional Hispanic voters in the next Presidential cycle. \u2026 It was, in effect, an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton for President campaign. \u2026 In the end, Google was disappointed. As Mario herself conceded \u201cultimately after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us. We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump. No one did. \u2013Tucker Carlson\nWatch:\n\ufeff\nSo it looks like @Google executives have been caught red-handed trying to throw the election to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Maybe that\u2019s why they refused to appear before Congress last week?https://t.co/1YELagt8hH \u2014 Andrew Surabian (@Surabees) September 11, 2018\nThis, of course, isn\u2019t the first evidence of Google doing all they could to help Hillary win the election. In an April 15, 2014 email from Google\u2019s then-Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt found in the WikiLeaked Podesta emails, titled \u201cNotes for a 2016 Democratic Campaign,\u201d Schmidt tells Cheryl Mills that \u201cI have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better. This is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all.\u201d\nWhile there are numerous curious nuances in the plan, presented below in its entirety, the one section that caught our \u2013 and Wikileaks\u2019 attention \u2013 is the following which implicitly suggests Google planned the creation of a voter tracking database, using smart phones: Guilty as Sin: Uncover... Edward Klein Best Price: $2.30 Buy New $3.99 (as of 12:05 EDT - Details)\nKey is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify, meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about (\u201cthe benefits of ACA to you\u201d etc.)\nAs a reminder, in late October of 2016 it was revealed that just days prior to the April 15, 2014 email, Schmidt had sent another email in which he expressed his eagerness to \u201cfund\u201d the campaign efforts and wants to be a \u201chead outside advisor.\u201d In the email from John Podesta to Robby Mook we learned that:\nI met with Eric Schmidt tonight. As David reported, he\u2019s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc. He was more deferential on structure than I expected. Wasn\u2019t pushing to run through one of his existing firms. Clearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to push others out. Clearly wants to get going. He\u2019s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon. I think it\u2019s worth doing. You around? If you are, and want to meet with him, maybe the four of us can get on t\nAnother email from February 2015 suggested that the Google Chairman remained active in its collaboration with the Clinton campaign: John Podesta wrote that Eric Schmidt met with HR \u201cabout the business he proposes to do with the campaign. He says he\u2019s met with HRC\u201d and adds that \u201cFYI. They are donating the Google plane for the Africa trip\u201d\nMeanwhile, according to a Breitbart report by Allum Bokhari, \u201cBy inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate, search engines like Google can shift the opinions of undecided voters by up to 43.4 percent, according to new research by a team at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and reported exclusively by Breitbart News.\u201d\nThe lead author of the study, Dr. Robert Epstein, has previously conducted research into what he calls the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME). This research showed that the manipulation of results pages in search engines can shift the voting preferences of undecideds by anywhere between 20 and 80 percent, depending on the demographic. His latest research looks at how search engines can affect voters by suggesting negative or positive search terms when a political candidate\u2019s name is entered into the search bar. Dr. Epstein\u2019s research found that when negative search terms are suggested for a candidate, it can have a dramatic effect on voter opinion. \u2013Breitbart\nSo, despite Google\u2019s best efforts to help Clinton win the election, it simply wasn\u2019t enough.\nMeanwhile, Google has yet to answer why their search results for the word \u201cIdiot\u201d are vastly different from DuckDuckGo:\nVS:\nReprinted with permission from Zero Hedge.\nThe Best of Tyler Durden\n", ["Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["\u2018Silent Donation\u2019: Corporate Emails Reveal Google Executives Tried to Turn Out Latino Voters Who They Thought Would Vote For Clinton\nGoogle, once again, has been implicated in a story about how social media executives and employees are using their platforms to control and shutter conservative ideas.

When will something be done about these tech and social media companies?\nFrom Breitbart:\nAn email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nIn the emails, a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls\u2013a get-out-the-vote for Hispanic voters operation\u2013and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016. She also used the term \u201csilent donation\u201d to describe Google\u2019s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president.\nThe main email, headlined, \u201cElection results and the Latino vote,\u201d was sent on Nov. 9, 2016\u2014the day after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election\u2014by Eliana Murillo, Google\u2019s Multicultural Marketing department head.\nThe four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non-partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another\u2014only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump.\nThe critical miscalculation, Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email, was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead-up to the election. Trump\u2019s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away, and he hit even higher numbers\u2014about 31 percent\u2014in the key battleground state of Florida, Murillo admitted.\nMurillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:\nWe worked very hard. Many people did. We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices. We kept our Google efforts non-partisan and followed our company\u2019s protocols for the elections strategy. We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work. Latinos voted in record-breaking numbers, particularly with early votes. A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote. We saw high traffic for the search queries \u2018votar,\u2019 \u2018como votar,\u2019 and \u2018donde voter,\u2019 in key states like Florida and Nevada. We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish. Without translating our tools the users wouldn\u2019t have found the information they needed. Objectively speaking, our goal was met \u2014 we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work. I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it. Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.\n\u201cSundar\u201d presumably refers to Google\u2019s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015. \u201cLisa\u201d presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google\u2014who forwarded Murillo\u2019s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo\u2019s activities with official company resources as having made a \u201cgreat difference.\u201d \u201cPhilipp\u201d presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google\u2019s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.\nThe emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report. Breitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.\nCarlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2014raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.\nCarlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and an expert on Google, who has said, in Carlson\u2019s words, \u201cGoogle alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it.\u201d\nEpstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections. Breitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein\u2019s reports, including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters.\nIn his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained. Carlson said:\nThis wasn\u2019t a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say. It wasn\u2019t aimed at all potential voters. It wasn\u2019t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups. Google didn\u2019t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles\u2014they sometimes vote Republican. It was aimed only at one group, a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party. Furthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign. This was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting. It was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.\u201d\nCarlson noted that in communication with Google, the company \u201cdid not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.\u201d\n\u201cTheir only defense was that the activities they described were either non-partisan or were not officially taken by the company,\u201d Carlson said Monday night, describing Google\u2019s official response to his requests for comment, before challenging the company\u2019s response: \u201cBut of course they were both. Plenty of people in Google knew what was going on and we haven\u2019t seen any evidence anyone at Google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in.\u201d\nThe email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:\nWe had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more. We promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation\u2019s non-partisan #YoVoyaVotaryTu (I\u2019m going to vote, are you?) campaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends\u2019 reach to hit over 11M impressions with that hashtag. We hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the Latino vote and the new research Nielsen published about the Latino electorate. This reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election. We brought the same research to the LATISM conference, where people were beyond thrilled to see Google\u2019s support and acknowledgment of the Latino community.\nIf Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story. But she did not: She went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of Google\u2019s actions, including a remarkable in-writing confirmation that at least one of Google\u2019s actions amounted to a \u201csilent donation\u201d\u2014something that could raise Federal Election Commission (FEC) red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter, now that these emails have been publicly revealed.\nIt is in the next paragraph that Murillo openly admits that Google made a \u201csilent donation,\u201d in her words, paying for rides to polls via leftist organization Voto Latino. Murillo wrote in the next paragraph:\nWe also supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states (silent donation). We even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help). We supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote. They were a strong partner, among many in this effort.\nThe next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.\n\u201cUltimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,\u201d Murillo wrote. \u201cWe never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump. No one did. We saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 had awoken.\u201d\nOn the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: \u201c2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?\u201d\nUnder that was a tweet from Jon Ralston of Ralston Reports in Nevada saying, among other things, that \u201cTrump is dead\u201d because of Latino turnout in early voting in the state. Trump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states. \u2026\nAt that point, after the Ralston tweet, Murillo openly admits the partisan motives of Google\u2019s electioneering efforts.\n\u201cOn personal note, we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers,\u201d Murillo wrote. \u201cWe read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!\u201d\nMurillo\u2019s email continues by including another headline, this time from the New Yorker\u2019s Benjamin Wallace-Wells: \u201cLatino Voters Show Trump What It Means to Be American.\u201d That piece was written on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election.\nThen she begins writing again: \u201cBut then reality set in. Only 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\nThe third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a Latina woman in a red Make America Great Again hat and \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d sign. The story, from Ruben Navarette, Jr., published in the Daily Beast, is headlined: \u201cWhy the Latino Vote Didn\u2019t Save America.\u201d The sub-headline, \u201cHispanic voters were supposed to be one of Clinton\u2019s blue firewalls\u2014but one in three ended up splitting for Trump,\u201d is also included in Murillo\u2019s Google email.\nFrom there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:\nThe voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida. Latino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college. We\u2019ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election. We know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next. Thanks again for all your help and support in this effort.\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo again openly admits she was not \u201cobjective\u201d when it came to the election.\n\u201cI have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,\u201d Murillo wrote. \u201cThis is devastating for our Democratic Latino community. After all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all. We are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don\u2019t know what the future holds for them.\u201d\nAfter that, Murillo says she cannot communicate with key organizers of the effort by Google and its partners\u2014a project known as HOLA\u2014because she is afraid of secret pro-Trump spies on the listservs created. She also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving Hillary Clinton supporters hugs after Trump crushed her on election day. She also says those involved in Google\u2019s get-out-the-vote efforts were openly seeking consolation after Clinton lost, and that she and another person cried after Trump won \u2013 for the first time they have cried due to an election result. Murillo wrote:\nWhat\u2019s most difficult for us is we can\u2019t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters. There is a thread right now among the core HOLA group where people are sharing how much they hurt, how much they need support right now, and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other. One in a remote office said \u2018If you guys do any sort of meetings, I\u2019d love to join virtually. I think I\u2019m currently the only Latinx in my office. It\u2019s kinda hard.\u2019 #understatement. Another said, \u2018I\u2019ve never cried after an election until last night.\u2019 Same here.\nShe was not done there. In the next paragraph, Murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly. She also admits the election result was a \u201closs,\u201d another indication that Google\u2019s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect Democrat Clinton over Republican Trump and influence the results of the election. She also says that the company\u2014and herself in particular\u2014will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.\n\u201cI\u2019m in shock and it hurts more than I could have ever imagined, but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high,\u201d Murillo wrote. \u201cLoss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative. My partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing \u2014 time to keep working harder.\u201d\nAt the top of the fourth page of the email, Murillo asks her colleagues at Google to give out a \u201csmile\u201d to grieving leftist Latinos who work at the company.\n\u201cIf you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,\u201d Murillo wrote. \u201cThey are probably hurting right now. It\u2019s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever. At least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.\u201d\nThen, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to \u201ccelebrate\u201d a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation \u201cwill be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.\u201d\nMurillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,\u201d she wrote.\nThis email leaked to Fox News and Breitbart News and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that Google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President of the United States.\nThis email from Murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside Google. Her original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.\n\u201cThought you all would want to read this,\u201d Gevelber wrote in her own message endorsing Murillo\u2019s email in a message to other Google bigwigs. \u201cIt\u2019s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.\u201d\nGevelber continued by commending everyone she said, \u201cworked so hard to ensure all the Get out the Vote were done in Spanish\u201d that their efforts \u201cmade a giant difference\u201d in the election \u201cto Googlers and beyond.\u201d\nPresident Trump and Republicans have just begun scratching the surface of bias against them among Silicon Valley\u2019s elite, including, perhaps foremost alongside Facebook, from Google. A source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes.\n\u2026\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Facebook Bans Outline to Stop Jihadi Attacks on Americans.\n[Editors' note: To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 for his article on how to best prevent more 9/11s, pre-order Jamie's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE.

It is no surprise, therefore, that Frontpage\u2019s editor, and host of \u2018The Glazov Gang,\u2019 was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday, on September 11, after posting his article, \u20189 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\u2019 Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe \u2014 and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day.\nThe report said it appears \u201cthat daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards.'\u201d\n\u201cGlazov\u2019s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims \u2013 a move that is, clearly, horrifying to Facebook\u2019s masters and therefore also violates their \u2018community standards,'\u201d the report said.\nNo doubt, Glazov\u2019s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM, honor killings and other Shariah barbarities, has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook\u2019s guardians \u2014 who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls.\nThe report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim\u2019s threat to him.\nTwitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts, citing its anti-\u201chate\u201d policies.\nIt is \u2018hateful conduct,\u2019 apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.

A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday. According to a report by The Intercept, the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University and concerns an incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school. According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman. The letter reportedly was given to Feinstein by Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., but has not been publicly disclosed by senators who have seen the document. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said that the letter in question has been referred to the FBI for investigation. The FBI conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees. \u201cUpon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s background file, as per the standard process,\u201d the FBI said in a statement.\nThe White House has called this nothing more than a last minute gambit, and that would be correct. In fact, the FBI has no plans to pursue any investigation regarding the allegation.\nAccording to The Washington Post:\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter, which would normally be handled by local authorities, if it was within the statute of limitations. The FBI instead passed the material to the White House, as an update to Kavanaugh's background check, which already had been completed, the person said. The move is similar to what the bureau did when allegations were leveled against former White House aide Rob Porter. ... Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the controversy on Twitter. \u201cLet me get this straight: this is [a] statement about [a] secret letter regarding a secret matter and an unidentified person. Right,\u201d he tweeted sarcastically. \u201cI will add: the FBI already performed and has reported on a background investigation on the nominee and thhttp://ericposner.com/is-brett-kavanaugh-an-originalist/is has been made available to all Senators on the Judiciary Committee,\u201d Cornyn wrote.\nExactly! This is political theater over a man who is not an originalist and not a strict Constitutionalist. He's a precedence man! He's said it over and over! If they wanted something on the guy, why don't they bring up his involvement in the Vince Foster cover-up? Now, that would be something to really look into, but not with the corrupt DOJ and FBI we currently have.

The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has, with the help of the Left, successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the West -- on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders. Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]\nFrontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory: Facebook has lifted Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov's 30-day ban on Facebook, apologizing and saying that the block was a \u201cmistake\u201d.\nWe have no doubt, of course, that no \u201cmistake\u201d had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received.\nWhile it is a positive development that Facebook has lifted the ban on Jamie (for now), this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever, seeing that Facebook, and all of leftist-run social media, is, at this moment, clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives. (See Jamie's video on this whole surreal affair HERE).\nA brief recap of Jamie's story: on Sept. 11, the 17th Anniversary of the 9/11 terror strike, Facebook's Unholy Alliance masters informed Jamie that he was suspended from Facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article, 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad, which Facebook informed him violated their \"community standards.\" This suggested, of course, that giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11, and all other Jihadist attacks against America, is now against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards\u2019. (Read the whole story HERE.)\nFrontpage and Jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of Facebook. Then, yesterday, on Sept. 13, Facebook notified Jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block.\nIt goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie's banning had received. And we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the Internet, including especially from Breitbart, PJMedia, WorldNetDaily and Thomas Lifson at American Thinker. Leading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie, tweeting about his ban -- and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation.\nJamie is, of course, no stranger to social media censorship -- especially of the insane variety. The Counter Jihad Coalition's (CJC) Facebook page, which Jamie helped run with CJC President Steve Amundson, was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation. The CJC is a human rights and pro-national security group that is dedicated to protecting America and the West from Jihad -- and Muslim and non-Muslim people from Sharia oppression. The question remains: why would Facebook remove such a page, let alone in such a fascistic manner -- and never explain why?\nIn April earlier this year, Jamie was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of a Muslim's threat to him on the platform. Then, in May, his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts. His account was suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s rules relating to \u201chateful conduct.\u201d It is \"hateful conduct\", apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say. Indeed, Frontpage's editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari\u2019s texts discussing Mohammed\u2019s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Qur'anic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).\nOne thing we know for sure is that, despite this lifting of Jamie\u2019s ban, Facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices. On Facebook, many brave conservative truth-tellers continue to be censored in myriad ways; these individuals include Anni Cyrus, Bosch Fawstin, Mark Lutchman and, of course, Diamond & Silk. The case of #WalkAway leader Brandon Straka is especially disturbing: he was recently banned by Facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by Alex Jones. Prager U has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of Facebook and then, only after vociferous protest, re-appear.\nFacebook is, of course, just one terrain of this leftist brownshirt-style assault on free speech. Everyone knows by now, for instance, what has happened, in the most Orwellian sense, to Alex Jones and InfoWars on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Leading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer, meanwhile, is not just a target at Facebook, where his referrals are down 90% from what they once were; he has been banned by Patreon at the behest of MasterCard -- and MasterCard has yet to respond to his lawyer\u2019s letter. GoFundMe has also banned Spencer because of a smear by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) hate machine.\nSpeaking of Mastercard, the David Horowitz Freedom Center just recently won a major battle with the credit card, defeating well-financed leftwing groups that are trying to run the Center out of business and suffocate free speech in America. The Freedom Center emerged victorious, but it is clear that leftist hate groups such as the SPLC and Color of Change.org are preparing new attacks against the Freedom Center and other conservative groups and individuals 24/7.\nTo be sure, the Left's attacks on the David Horowitz Freedom Center continue unabated: just recently a hit piece in the Washington Post smeared a stand-up noble gentleman like Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Republican Ron DeSantis, libeling David Horowitz in the process. The article stated falsely and maliciously that Horowitz's Restoration Weekend, that DeSantis had attended, was somehow \u201ca racially charged event\u201d -- a vicious lie that Frontpage has exposed and for which the Washington Post is still to apologize and issue a retraction. (To learn why David Horowitz is one of the central targets of the Left, make sure to watch this video).\nThus, we clearly gauge that there is no disgusting and venomous level to which the Left will not stoop in its destructive agenda. Yes, Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov has had his ban lifted at Facebook, but this is clearly only a brief reprieve for him on that platform -- and it is only, obviously, a very tiny space in the Stalinist Left's war on America and on everything on which it stands.\nAt this dire moment, we all need to amplify our voices in defense of free speech. And we need to adamantly defend all the truth-tellers at the very moment they come under attack. We also need to contact our representatives and to call for a Congressional investigation into this pernicious assault by the fascist Left on our liberties.\nThe battle for America -- and for the West -- is on.\n[Editors' postscript: Please make sure to FOLLOW Jamie Glazov on Facebook as well as on Twitter (@JamieGlazov) to strengthen his social media strength in the face of the Left's vicious war on free speech.

The door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger\u2019s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.\u201d\n\u201cGuyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by \u2026 Jean,\u201d according to the warrant. \u201cGuyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso. Guyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to \u2026 Jean.\n\u201cDue to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911. Upon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant.\nAt no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what \u201cverbal commands\u201d she gave. What\u2019s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder\u2014not Jean. Attempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who\u2019d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.\nWhat\u2019s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment\u2014implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start.\n\u201cFrom the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,\u201d Attorney Daryl Washington said. \u201cWell, the very first thing that I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m not going to go outside and look at my address? I\u2019m going to give them my address right there on the phone. I\u2019m going to say I\u2019m on the phone. My address is this. Why did she have to go outside to verify the address? It makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d\nEven more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger\u2019s story of inserting the key into Jean\u2019s door and it opening up was simply not true. According to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean\u2019s door, demanding he let her in.\n\u201cIndependent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,\u201d Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News. \u201cThe contradictions begin to build from there.\u201d\nThe doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism. This was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times\u2014showing that it closed every single time\u2014blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.\nJean\u2019s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean\u2019s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.\nThe hallway outside the apartment where Botham Jean was shot and killed by a Dallas Police officer. pic.twitter.com/2xN9xqppRC \u2014 Allison Harris (@AllisonFox4News) September 8, 2018\nEven as cops come to Guyger\u2019s defense and attempt to shame, smear, and discredit her victim\u2014who was an upstanding member of society regardless of the plant they claim to have found\u2014they are failing miserably.\nDespite cops rallying behind the blue line to defend this killer cop, the rest of the country is not buying it.

They have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school. The accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. She conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on-the-record interview with the Washington Post. The accuser\u2019s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology.\nJudge Kavanaugh issued a statement on Friday in which he said, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"\nSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford. Even though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge. Instead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman\u2019s wish to keep the matter confidential. Senator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI. The FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation. Senator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because \u201cthe incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion\u201d and she had already \u201ctaken care of it,\u201d according to a source quoted by The New Yorker. Nevertheless, Senator Feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour.\nThe New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation. However, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her \u201ccivic responsibility\u201d and tell her own story publicly. How convenient, coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote! The whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set-up, reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last-minute attempt to derail Justice Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation.\nChristine Blasey Ford claims, according to the Washington Post article, that \u201cone summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend \u2014 both \u2018stumbling drunk,\u2019 Ford alleges \u2014 corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County. While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. \u2018I thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u2019\u201d Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\u201d\nHere is where Ms. Ford\u2019s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart. Although Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she \u201csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident,\u201d according to the Washington Post article. For example, Ms. Ford \u201csaid she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.\u201d She also does not remember how she got home. Yet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident.\nMs. Ford admitted that she \u201ctold no one at the time what had happened to her.\u201d In fact, she said she recalled thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not ever telling anyone this. This is nothing, it didn\u2019t happen, and he didn\u2019t rape me.\u201d Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she \u201ctold no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,\u201d according to the Washington Post article. Most revealingly, the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist\u2019s notes, portions of which were provided by Ms. Ford for the Washington Post\u2019s review. The therapist\u2019s notes \u201cdo not mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students \u2018from an elitist boys\u2019 school\u2019 who went on to become \u2018highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.\u2019\u201d\nIn other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school \u2013 a therapist\u2019s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident \u2013 did not mention Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s name. Judge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced. Ms. Ford may believe her story to be true, but the lack of any credible corroborating evidence, her partial memory of details surrounding the alleged incident, and the absence of any pattern of such sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh undercut the reliability of her version of the incident.\nIn a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Feinstein, 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character:\nWe are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983. For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect\u2026 Brett attended Georgetown Prep, an all-boys high school in Rockville, Maryland. He was an outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends. Almost all of us attended all-girls high schools in the area. We knew Brett well through social events, sports, church, and various other activities. Many of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years.

That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day. The signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views. Many of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person. And he has always been a good person.\nNevertheless, using their standard contemptible, obstructionist tactics, the Democrats opposed to Judge Kavanaugh happily seized on the unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior in high school to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s character. They have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s lifetime record of stellar public service, multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct, and the letter written by the 65 women, who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character.\nFeminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass because his policies were in line with their ideology. Senator Feinstein called Ted \u201cChappaquiddick\u201d Kennedy an \"inspiration and a friend,\" presumably also based on their compatible ideologies. Hypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation of decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief, Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation for ideological reasons have debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign against an eminently qualified candidate for the Supreme Court.\nPredictably, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats, including Senator Feinstein, have called for the Senate to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh. \"Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,\u201d Senator Schumer said. If a thorough investigation was considered to be so important, why didn't Senator Feinstein set the ball rolling back in July when she first received word of the allegation? The answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by all means necessary. Senator Schumer is fulfilling his promise to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with \"everything I've got.\"\nAs of now, the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican majority plans to move forward with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination as scheduled.

An unprovable accusation from decades ago that the accuser said nothing about until years later, and that is uncorroborated by any other testimony or by the evidence of any similar behavior on Kavanaugh\u2019s part.

She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes. Here\u2019s the core of her story:\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. \u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u201d said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. \u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling. She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.\nDo not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault. I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale. This isn\u2019t \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d Actions have consequences, and it\u2019s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this \u2014 even a long time ago \u2014 he has to remain \u201cmerely\u201d a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nSince Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot. At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.\nYet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred. We don\u2019t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court. I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton \u2014 or for any other politician who\u2019s accused of misconduct. Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true?\nGiven the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment. I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault. I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls. But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men. So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment. Here\u2019s why:\nFirst, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration. Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred? With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration. Here, there was not. According to the Washington Post, \u201cFord said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.\u201d\nThat\u2019s almost three decades of silence \u2014 three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.\nBut even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem. They actually contradict her story on a key detail. According to the Post, \u201cThe notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist\u2019s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.\u201d Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.\nThose are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.\nAs a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails. Juries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes \u2014 after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn\u2019t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.\nAt least the investigation seems somewhat manageable. If there were only four boys there, who were the other two? Let\u2019s hear from them. In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.\nYet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party? Would they remember any details at all? If someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford\u2019s account. If another attendee says, \u201cHe was totally sober and with me the whole time,\u201d that helps Kavanaugh. But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie \u2014 for either person\u2026.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["New Mexico Jihadis\u2019 Defense Attorney: \u201cIf These Were White Christians\u2026No One Would Bat An Eye\u201d\nEditor's Note: If they were white, devout Christians, we wouldn't hear about this cause it would have never taken place because it would have gone against the teachings of Christ and there would have been an outcry by Christians everywhere against people might engage in such behavior and would claim such things.\n\u201cFederal prosecutors say that between Dec. 2017 and August 2018, the group, who are either siblings or related by marriage, had \u2018a common plan to prepare for violent attacks on government, military, educational and financial institutions.'\u201d\nYeah, if they were white Christians, no one would care about that.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWho should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

Trump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News. The 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format.

One of the most glaring instances showing her privilege was the fact that the Texas Rangers said in their report that Jean refused to obey Guyger\u2019s \u201cverbal commands.\u201d Had anyone else but a cop walked into an apartment and killed an innocent man, do you believe that investigators would have said anything like this?\nAttorney Stephen Le Brocq, who operates a law firm in the North Texas area sums up the treatment of Guyger perfectly when he says that \u201cThe affidavit isn\u2019t written objectively, not at the slightest. As stated before, they are usually wholly against the accused. An objective view of the information related by the officer would be proper, in my opinion. This affidavit states facts based upon the word of the person it seeks to accuse of criminal wrongdoing.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, according to WFAA, who obtained affidavits for all of the search warrants involved in the case, none of them involved the search of Guyger\u2019s apartment.\nFor those who don\u2019t recall, police egregiously released the search warrant findings of Jean\u2019s apartment on the day his family buried his dead body. They attempted to assassinate Jean\u2019s character by claiming they found less than a half ounce of weed in his apartment. However, they failed miserably at it.\nOne thing in particular, however, stood out to those paying attention and that is the fact the police didn\u2019t release any information on what they found in Guyger\u2019s apartment. According to the information currently available, that\u2019s because they didn\u2019t search it.\nAccording to WFAA, there were five search warrants issued in the case\u2014none of which were for the killer\u2019s apartment. As WFAA reports:\nTwo of the warrants allowed investigators to remove the front door of Guyger and Jean\u2019s apartment, their door locks and to download data for their door locks. An inventory return states that they removed both of their door lock and downloaded the data from the door locks. A third search warrant gave investigators the authority to enter Jean\u2019s apartment and collect additional evidence. A return shows that investigators took photographs of his apartment, made videos of his apartment, conducted \u201claser measurements of firearm trajectory,\u201d and collected \u201cgunshot residue\u201d from the door frame and kitchen wall of Jean\u2019s apartment. A return for the fourth search warrant shows investigators seized video from the surveillance camera system in the apartment management\u2019s office. A fifth search warrant gave investigators the authority to obtain all communications related to the incident in the possession of property management, as well as all surveillance video and all entry and access logs from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on the night of the shooting. An inventory return shows investigators seized a USB drive containing the video, an event log report for \u201clinear access doors and gates,\u201d an \u201celevator access door lock\u201d report and a \u201clock audit report for both apartments.\nNow, even if police would try to search the killer cop\u2019s apartment, it\u2019s too late.

(A tyrant, moreover, who has ascended to the papacy in a manner reminiscent of the ascension of the corrupt Benedict IX, another \u201cdisgrace to the Chair of Peter,\u201d following the machinations of a Roman cabal, as I discuss below.)\nQuoth Fisher:\nI have a number of friends who have escaped abusive marriages. They tell me that Pope Francis is sounding more and more like the men who abused them. He\u2019s sounding like the men who hid that abuse from the world, who taught their victims to blame themselves, who used spiritual pressure to persuade them and their families that it would actually be wrong, sinful, to defend themselves. Just listen to him. After responding to a question about Vigano\u2019s very serious accusations, he said point blank, \u201cI will not say a single word on this.\u201d\u2026 [F]or the rest of the week and more, he kept up an unmistakable theme of calling for silence, equating silence with holiness, and painting himself as a Christlike victim in his silence. Then he says it\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d to accuse others of sinning. Then he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws\u2026. To the victims of the Church, and to those who love them, it sounds like he is saying, \u201cWho do you think you are? I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you. You\u2019re the guilty one. You brought this on yourself. If you want to be loved, then know your place. I\u2019m the victim, here, not you. If you know what\u2019s good for you, keep your mouth shut.\u201d This is how abusers talk. They\u2019re not content with power; they have to keep their victims doubting and blaming themselves constantly, so they don\u2019t become a threat. Whether Francis knows it or not, this is how he sounds.\nWe can overlook the fig leaf \u201cwhether Francis knows it or not\u2026\u201d. Fisher knows that Francis knows it, even if she still cannot bring herself to say explicitly what should now be apparent to the entire body of the faithful: that Bergoglio\u2019s very presence on the Chair of Peter is a grave threat to the common good of the Church and the integrity of the Faith.\nClick below to Subscribe to The Remnant's YouTube channel!\nYet Fisher maintains a sliver of space for deniability in order to maintain that indispensable distinction between her and those loathsome traditionalists: \u201cI don\u2019t have any ideological reason to want to bring him down. I have defended him as long as I could, up until the Chile debacle. And so I am working as hard as I can not to assume the worst, not to believe that this man who promised so much fresh air is really so intent on slamming doors shut before we find out even worse things hidden inside. But he is not making it easy. I am not saying he is an abuser. But he sounds like one.\u201d\nThat is, Fisher was not concerned about Bergoglio\u2019s relentless assault on traditional Catholic teaching and practice\u2014to her, opposition to Francis on that account is just \u201cideology\u201d\u2014but only his role in covering up sexual abuse by bishops and priests. But why is Fisher still \u201cworking hard not to assume the worst\u201d when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years?\nIndeed, why else did Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 risk everything in order to expose this Pope, even to the extent of revealing matters supposedly within the scope of \u201cthe Pontifical secret\u201d? On orders of the Vatican Secretary of State, the Vatican secret police are reportedly scouring the globe in search of Vigan\u00f2, who has gone into hiding, \u201cin order to prevent more unpredictable damage to the image of Pope Francis and the Holy See on the world stage, but also to \u2018prepare the terrain\u2019 for the former apostolic nuncio-turned-whistleblower to be prosecuted\u201d under canon law.\nThe Dictator Pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far. Everything depends on it! But it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power. At last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation.\nNow even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go:\nOf what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Vigan\u00f2, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians? By what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the Chair of Peter? Does the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning? Vigan\u00f2 is unquestionably in a position to know, and claims to know, whether his central allegation that Francis\u2019 was covering for McCarrick, big time, for years, is correct. Believing, as he does, that his claims are correct, Vigan\u00f2, in calling for Francis\u2019 resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law \u201cto manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful\u2026\u201d 1983 CIC 212 \u00a7 3. I have not called for Francis\u2019 resignation because I do not know (with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks) whether Vigan\u00f2\u2019s key allegations against Francis are substantially true; most assuredly, however, if I reach the conclusion that they are true, I would say, without hesitation, that Francis should resign.\nBergoglio will not, of course, resign. He will cling to power with his last breath in order to carry out the many other acts of ecclesial subversion he clearly has in mind. The only remedies for the plague of Bergoglio are his natural death or deposition.\nYes, deposition. Canon212 has linked to an interesting and timely piece on the role of the Synod of Sutri, near Rome, in 1046, which dealt with the problem of three rival claimants to the papacy, each installed by a Roman faction: First, the execrable Benedict IX, mentioned above. Second, the interloper Sylvester III, installed in the Chair of Peter after Benedict had been driven from Rome. Third, the well-intentioned but dimwitted Gregory VI, whose election was tainted by a seemingly simoniacal negotiation with Benedict, who had returned to Rome in 1045 and ousted Sylvester, according to which Benedict would receive a generous pension if he resigned the papacy, which Benedict did only to rescind his resignation.\nThe Synod was convoked by Henry III, the German king and soon-to-be-crowned Holy Roman Emperor, a pious and austere Christian and an exponent of the Cluniac spirit of reform. The Synod declared that Benedict IX (who had refused to appear) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation. As for Sylvester, the Synod declared that he be \u201cstripped of his sacerdotal rank and shut up in a monastery.\u201d Gregory was also declared deposed, either by the act of the Synod itself or by Gregory\u2019s own voluntary resignation in view of the Synod.\nAt Henry III\u2019s designation, the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II, but he died after only a year, whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047, only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048. Damasus II, another German bishop designated by Henry, reigned for a mere three weeks before dying, whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy, reigning until 1054. Leo, as John Rao observes, was the first in a line of Popes who \u201ctook charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration\u201d which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections. (Rao, Black Legends, 147-148).\nAs the cited article on the Synod of Sutri notes, although the scurrilous Benedict IX objected to his deposition by the Synod, \u201cthe Church has always accepted his deposition as valid. The King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope, who promptly crowned the King, Holy Roman Emperor. Benedict IX, after the death of Clement, claimed the papacy again! The Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope.\u201d\nMoreover, Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope\u2014a valid but deposed Pope\u2014during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes. This was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations. Indeed, even the Vatican\u2019s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force.\nOnly with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee. By 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College \u201chave held it ever since.\u201d (Eric John, The Popes, 181).\nThese lessons of history should suffice to dispel the pious fable, never a teaching of the Magisterium, that every Pope is chosen by the Holy Ghost to lead the Church. This theological error, which Bergoglio has exploited to the hilt, is a key element in the related error of papalotry, which elevates the person of the Pope above the office he occupies and makes of him the leader of a personality cult everyone is commanded to \u201clove\u201d (in the superficially emotional sense) and obey no matter what he says or does, rather than a custodian and defender of the Deposit of Faith whose lovability, personality and opinions are utterly irrelevant to the exercise and scope of his office.\nAs Pope Benedict has observed, when it comes to the election of a Pope \u201cthe Spirit\u2019s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that he [sic] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote\u2026. There are too many contrary instances of popes the Holy Spirit obviously would not have picked!\u201d Bergoglio is undeniably one of them.\nSo what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio? That the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church, but it certainly does not. As to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity. And just as a synod was employed to address three rival claimants to the papal throne in 1046, declaring at least two of them deposed, so today might it be possible for reform-minded cardinals and bishops, comprising an imperfect council, to undo the incalculable damage caused by the cabal that lobbied for Bergoglio\u2019s election before the last conclave\u2014a cabal that included none other than McCarrick, whom Bergoglio rewarded by rehabilitating that monster despite the massive evidence of his unspeakable crimes.\nWhat would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates? One could readily point to the evidence that a faction that included Bergoglio himself had agreed upon his election before the conclave, and that all those involved, including Bergoglio, were thereby excommunicated latae sententiae in accordance with Article 81 of John Paul II\u2019s Universi Dominici Gregis, which provides:\nThe Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact, agreement, promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons. If this were in fact done, even under oath, I decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no one shall be bound to observe it; and I hereby impose the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae upon those who violate this prohibition.\nTo quote Cajetan on this point (citations taken from the linked article by Robert Siscoe), deposition by an imperfect council is appropriate \u201cwhen one or more Popes suffer uncertainty with regard to their election, as seems to have arisen in the schism of Urban VI and others. Then, lest the Church be perplexed, those members of the Church who are available have the power to judge which is the true pope, if it can be known, and if it cannot be known, [it has] the power to provide that the electors agree on one or another of them.\u201d\nI am not saying that such a case has been proven. Rather, what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly, and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX.\nAnother ground for deposition\u2014as determined by the imperfect council, not any of us\u2014would be that Bergoglio has deposed himself by promulgating heresy, fracturing the Church\u2019s universal discipline respecting marriage and the Eucharist, and undermining the teaching of even his own immediate predecessors on matters of fundamental morality upheld by the Magisterium for two millennia. Surely the Church cannot be without any remedy for a Pope who relentlessly attacks her very foundations! To quote Cajetan again: \u201cIndeed the Church has the right to separate herself from an heretical pope according to divine law. Consequently, it has the right, by the same divine law, to use all means of themselves necessary for such separation; and those that juridically correspond to the crime, are of themselves necessary\u201d\u2014meaning the resort to an imperfect council.\nIf a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046, why not an imperfect council today\u2014or, for that matter, another synod? It will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church. But that would not be the first time that defense of the Church\u2019s common good has done so, as the Great Western Schism demonstrates. And are we not in the midst of schisms already, provoked by none other than Bergoglio himself, whose insane drive to shatter the Church\u2019s bimillennial discipline has produced the totally unprecedented situation in which what is still considered mortally sinful in one diocese is an imperative of \u201cmercy\u201d in another?\nIn any case, this much is certain: barring Bergoglio\u2019s conversion and reversal of course, the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer. One way or another, the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit. Either the human element of the Church will act according to the means which seem possible, however extraordinary, or Heaven itself will intervene in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement due to the negligence of time-serving pastors who left their sheep completely undefended against the wolves who preyed upon them, including the wolf the cardinals improvidently elected Pope.\nSome four months before Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk, the Archbishop of Utrecht, Netherlands, perhaps the most liberal territory in the entire Church, protested that Bergoglio\u2019s blatant nod to intercommunion with Protestants in Germany means that \u201cthe bishops and, above all, the Successor of Peter fail to maintain and transmit faithfully and in unity the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture\u201d and that the situation reminds him of Article 675 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which refers to the Church\u2019s \u201cfinal trial\u201d before the Second Coming, \u201cthat will shake the faith of many believers\u2026 [a] \u2018mystery of iniquity\u2019 in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth.\nWhat can the Church do when confronted by a Pope who, as a prominent cardinal declares to the whole world, \u201cfail[s] to maintain and transmit faithfully \u2026 the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture\u201d and is leading \u201can apostasy from the truth\u201d? It seems absurd to argue that she can do nothing but exhort the faithful to pray and do penance while a papal malefactor, treated as if were an absolute dictator, is allowed to continue wreaking havoc upon faith and morals to the detriment of countless souls, without the least impediment, for so long as he shall live.\nNo, Bergoglio must go. The successors of the Apostles, the only ones in a position to end his rampage, must demand his resignation and, should he refuse as expected, act in this unprecedented emergency to declare his removal from the office he has criminally abused and whose very credibility he threatens to destroy. May God give them the grace to do what must be done and what history will vindicate as a rescue of the Church during the height of the worst crisis in her history.\n", ["Guilt_by_Association", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Exposing the Deep State Plotters\nPresident Trump\u2019s sweeping order this week directing intelligence agencies to declassify documents from the more than 18-month-old investigation related to the Left\u2019s electoral collusion conspiracy theory involving Trump and Russia may shed light on what really happened in the 2016 election.\nIn an interview with Hill.TV yesterday, the president said he ordered the mass declassification to show the public that the FBI investigation of the conspiracy theory began as a \u201choax.\u201d Exposing it could be one of the \u201ccrowning achievements\u201d of his presidency, he said.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is a great service to the country, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to be able to call this, along with tax cuts and regulation and all the things I\u2019ve done\u2026 in its own way this might be the most important thing because this was corrupt.\u201d\nTrump criticized how the FBI handled the Russia probe, accusing it of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court, and of spying on his campaign.\n\u201cThey know this is one of the great scandals in the history of our country because basically what they did is, they used [former Trump campaign aide] Carter Page, who nobody even knew, who I feel very badly for, I think he\u2019s been treated very badly.

(Carter Page is not related to Lisa Page.)\nAlthough the conspiracy theory is baseless nonsense, it continues to dog the Trump administration, providing cable television news outlets and late-night talk show hosts with endless fodder in the 24-hour news cycle.

It may even prove a political masterstroke of sorts for Trump.

Make the documents public and let the chips fall where they may.\nThere is so much leftist dirt to uncover.

(The exact message, time-stamped 1:50 p.m., reads \"Yes, bc potus wants to know everything we are doing.\") In a separate text message to Page, Strzok wrote something cryptic about an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d in case Donald Trump got elected. Apparently, he was referring to the salacious, unverified dossier Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid rent-a-spy Christopher Steele to compile that purports to show Trump\u2019s nefarious links to Russia.\nPresident Trump ordered that the relevant documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department \u201c[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,\u201d read a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\nTrump ordered the \u201cimmediate declassification\u201d of \u201cpages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W.

The 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format. The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\nIn comments to reporters and on Twitter, President Trump has been blasting Strzok and Page for months over their inappropriate behavior. Ditto for former FBI Director James Comey and one of his deputies, Andrew McCabe. Trump fired Comey in May 2017 and Attorney General Jeff Sessions canned McCabe in March.

While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man\u2019s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. That, Senator Ted Cruz, is wrong.\nMistake or not, she killed an innocent man. She is the only one to blame and yet she is still collecting a paycheck from taxpayers. Calling for Gugyer to be fired is not the same as calling for people to be fired for making stupid Instagram posts or saying stupid things\u2014she killed an innocent man. At the very least, she should be fired from her job which gave her the gun to do it.\nWhat Ted Cruz is doing is the same thing the police and their apologists are doing. They are treating Guyger differently because she is part of the system. In Cruz\u2019s eyes, Guyger going into an apartment that wasn\u2019t her\u2019s and killing an innocent man was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time\u2014a tragic mistake that ruined two lives, according to Cruz.\nBut that is not the case at all. Would Ted Cruz and police officers be following this same narrative if the roles were reversed? If it was Botham Jean, a black man, walking into the apartment of Amber Guyger, a white female cop, and killing her\u2014would police and Ted Cruz simply write it off as a tragic accident?\nOf course, we know the answer to that question and it is a resounding, NO.\nTo shut down the peanut gallery before it begins, this is not some case of Democrat versus Republican or right versus left. This is a case of right versus wrong, and what Amber Guyger did to Botham Jean was wrong. There is no other way around it, \u201cmistake\u201d or not.\nFrom the start of this case, law enforcement have set out to protect Guyger because she is part of their blue line. Amber Guyger\u2019s home was never searched while Jean\u2019s apartment was searched that night. The results of the blood test to test for alcohol or drugs in her system were never released, yet police \u2014 on the day his mother buried her son \u2014 claimed they found marijuana in his house. It\u2019s been a smear campaign from the beginning and it is this way by design.\nAmber Guyger took an innocent person\u2019s life, and because people are so blinded by the badge, she is being portrayed as the victim.

They deliberately refused to bring up the allegations, as weak and ridiculous as they are, at Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings because they didn\u2019t want to have a rational discussion.\nThey wanted to hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process.\nAnd so far it appears they\u2019re succeeding.\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded. The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nChristine Blasey Ford\u2019s lawyers are trying to game the system. They know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week\u2019s notice for a hearing. So, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court\u2019s new term begins. Of course, lawyers are masters of delay, and social justice warrior-lawyers hoping to torpedo President Trump\u2019s agenda have an added incentive to drag the confirmation process out as long as possible. New demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford\u2019s legal team.\nIt was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward. Kavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday. \u201cI continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,\" he wrote in a letter.\nFord's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client \"wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.\" Another Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are \u201cmultiple witnesses\u201d who need to testify.\n\"A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,\u201d Katz wrote in a letter. \u201cDr. Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested. Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.\u201d\nGOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford\u2019s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports:\nLate Thursday, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, said that his staff had discussed the issue with Ford\u2019s attorney earlier in the day and that he would consult with his fellow committee members about the next move. Ford\u2019s offer also increased the pressure on several key moderates \u2014 particularly GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 whose votes will probably be needed to put Kavanaugh on the high court. Both were already facing heavy pressure from abortion rights groups concerned that Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative and longtime GOP attorney, might vote to restrict access to abortion. The sexual assault allegation, which the nominee has denied, has upended his seemingly sure-bet confirmation and only increased the stakes for the key lawmakers.\nChairman Grassley had imposed a Thursday deadline for Ford to submit testimony after her team said Tuesday she wasn\u2019t willing to testify until the FBI investigates her sexual abuse allegations against Kavanaugh. Left-wingers such as Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed Ford\u2019s demand.\nThe demand for an FBI probe is \u201cutter nonsense,\u201d former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said earlier this week.\nFord \u201creally doesn\u2019t want to testify,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when she does, she is going to look like the loon she is. She may very well believe everything she\u2019s saying, and that is one of the signs of lunacy, believing something that isn\u2019t real.\u201d And her lawyer is \u201ceven loonier.\u201d\nBesides, diGenova explained, the eleventh-hour sexual abuse claim leveled against Kavanaugh is a non-federal matter and in this case the alleged assault hasn\u2019t even been clearly outlined by the alleged victim. Ford didn\u2019t report it to anyone for decades and isn\u2019t even certain when or where it happened, so the FBI can\u2019t investigate the matter \u201cbecause there is nothing to investigate.\u201d\nKavanaugh has already undergone six FBI background checks and the agency has ruled out investigating Ford\u2019s allegation of drunken groping at a teenagers\u2019 party 36 years ago. Ford\u2019s request for an FBI probe is \u201cclearly a desire to delay proceedings,\u201d diGenova said.\nPresident Trump is taking the high road and is avoiding attacking Ford, which isn\u2019t a risky move given how obviously unbalanced the accuser is. Ford is already doing an excellent job destroying herself without Republican assistance.\nAt the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said it would be \"wonderful\" if Ford testifies and \"unfortunate\" if she does not. He indicated he was keeping an open mind about the allegations but that it was \"very hard for me to imagine anything happened\" between her and the nominee.\n\"I think he's an extraordinary man \u2013 I think he's a man of great intellect, as I've been telling you, and he has an unblemished record,\" Trump said. \"This is a very tough thing for him and his family and we want to get over it but at the same time we want to give tremendous amounts of time.

It seemed like Chief Hall might not have been well informed on the law,\u201d said Moore.\nWFAA went further and noted that the \u201cthe Dallas Police Department general orders do allow the chief to take action, saying, \u2018The Chief of Police may circumvent all formal disciplinary procedures to render an immediate decision when it deems it necessary to preserve the integrity of the department.\u2019\u201d\nApparently, this \u201cintegrity\u201d is not worth preserving and the Dallas police are going out of their way to keep a killer cop on their payroll.\nAs WFAA pointed out, lots of cops across the state who have been under criminal investigation have been fired by police chiefs. This includes cops within the Dallas police department.\nAmy Wilburn, a former Dallas cop shot an unarmed teen in the stomach as he sat down with his hands in the air in 2013. Days later, after her account was found to be entirely false, she was fired for it. Wilburn became the first cop in 41 years \u2014 since officer Darrell Cain murdered a 12-year-old boy in the back of his squad car \u2014 to be indicted for shooting a suspect.\nAlso in 2013, officer Cardan Spencer shot a mentally ill man in his driveway. Days later, he was also fired after surveillance video proved he was lying about what happened.\nSo why hasn\u2019t the chief fired Gugyer, who has actually been charged, arrested, and admitted to killing an innocent man?\nLike all those accused of a crime, Amber Guyger deserves her day in court.

At the very least, she should be fired for this.\nBut then again, as we\u2019ve reported already this week, Amber Guyger is subject to a different set of rules than common citizens, which apparently includes keeping a paycheck after admitting to killing an unarmed, innocent, pillar of society, Botham Jean.\nArticle posted with permission from The Free Thought Project\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["If Kavanaugh Is Not Confirmed By Senate, Then We Are All Just One Accusation Away From Ruin\nIf Christine Ford were to make her accusation in any courtroom in America, even a mediocre defense attorney could shatter her credibility within minutes under cross-examination.

Charles Grassley (R-IA) is to be commended on his handling of the situation. In the spirit of compromise, he called off the Senate committee vote that had been on the calendar for Thursday and scheduled a hearing for next Monday so that both Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh could state their cases. Kavanaugh immediately responded to Grassley. For 36 hours, there was silence from the Ford camp. Then, their demands began.\nFirst, it was reported that Ford would answer questions, but only at a closed hearing and only after an FBI investigation had been completed.\nRepublicans felt that the request for a closed hearing was reasonable, but the demand for a new FBI investigation was not.\nThe FBI investigates federal crimes and/or national security issues. When the FBI received Dianne Feinstein\u2019s letter last week, they forwarded it to the White House to place in Kavanaugh\u2019s background check file. (Note: The FBI has already conducted six background checks on Kavanaugh, the most recent one was done this summer.)\nIt was announced later that Sen. Grassley would not change the date of the hearing set for Monday. Even Senators Jeff Flake, Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham, who have all said Ford needs to be heard, have indicated that if she does not show up for Monday's hearing, they will schedule a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Ford's highly partisan, activist attorney emailed Grassley saying, although her client strongly prefers that an investigation take place beforehand, Ford will testify next week, but she cannot do so on Monday. And she will only be questioned by members of the Senate panel, not outside lawyers.\nWhy not Monday? Does she have an important dentist appointment she can't get out of? In order to avoid the criticism that will no doubt come anyway, the Republicans on the Senate Judicial committee have tried very hard to oblige Ford's requests, even offering to go to California to hear her testimony.\nShe and her attorneys feel that they are in the driver's seat and thus, can call all the shots. Democrats want to delay this vote until after the midterms because they believe they have a chance to retake the Senate as well as the House.\nRush Limbaugh points out that the Senate has bent over backwards to accommodate the accuser. \"I don\u2019t care who you are, determine the scope and the parameters of an investigation. The accuser doesn\u2019t get to determine when and who investigates. In no circumstance in the country does that happen.\"\nIn addition to the political reasons for the delay requests, it appears as if this woman is reluctant to testify under oath, possibly because she doesn\u2019t want to perjure herself. Maybe she realizes the magnitude of what her accusations have unleashed. Either this did not happen at all or a much milder version of the situation she alleges occurred. Kavanaugh may have made a pass at her as 17-year-old boys (and even some 17-year-old girls) are known to do. Ford said no and that was it. Even she admits, they did not have sex, nor was this a hostage situation. The perception of events by a 15-year-old girl may differ significantly from reality. And 36 years can distort memories, one way or another.\nWhat is happening in the Brett Kavanaugh nomination process should concern every American. Whatever happened or did not happen, it's difficult to feel sorry for someone who comes forward at such a politically opportune moment. There was ample time to have addressed this in July or August, but Dianne Feinstein chose to sit on it until the moment it could inflict maximum political damage.\nDemocrats may be overestimating the strength of their hand. And Ms. Ford may be overestimating the integrity of the \"supportive\" lawmakers and lawyers currently handling her.

The allegation went public last week after Ms. Feinstein, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said she received a letter about the incident in late July and referred the matter to federal authorities a week ago. \u201cDuring every step of this process, I\u2019ve found every single piece of information from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford eminently credible, sincere and believable,\u201d tweeted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday. \u201cShe knew this would have a huge effect on her life and she was incredibly brave to come forward.\u201d\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Being Skeptical Of Documented Liars Attacking a Supreme Court Nominee Is A Good Thing - Here's Why\nIf you don\u2019t like President Trump and can\u2019t understand how anyone could, look no further than the past week for an excellent example of what on Earth could\u2019ve made a man promising to Drain the Swamp so popular.

Well, when every time there's a man that you don't like running for public office or being nominated for a position, some woman crawls out from a line of protesters and makes an ambiguous-at-best claim about unwanted sexual advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to take you seriously.\nNo, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not going to stop this process. And guess what, next time a man is nominated to a position who really has committed a crime, people will be that much less likely to believe his accuser. Way to go!

Immediately every Democrat publicly stated that they would vote No for his confirmation. On the other hand, every Republican publicly stated that they would vote Yes.\nCurrently, there's more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, which means the guy will be confirmed. There's an election 2 months away. The Democrats think that they'll take back the majority of Congress and will thus be able to block Trump's nomination. All they have to do is delay the confirmation until after the election. So, they dig up some Trump-hating woman from Kavanaugh\u2019s past and convince her to say that he assaulted her thinking that such an allegation will surely delay the vote long enough for them to regain control of Congress.\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see through this plan.\nThese are the facts. This is not my opinion. Everything else is just noise.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Red_Herring", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Kavanaugh and Last-Minute Accusations\nDemocrats are pulling out all the stops and enabling salacious last-minute accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy. Now that Christine Blasey Ford has finally agreed to testify this Thursday at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her charge that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a long-ago high school party, these new charges have suddenly emerged from left field.\nOn Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party. The New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators. The article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s, concerning \u201ca dormitory party gone awry.\u201d As the article acknowledged, however, \u201cher memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.\u201d The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was \u201creluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the alleged incident with certainty.\u201d It was only after \u201csix days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney\u201d that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being \u201cfoggy\u201d at the time. The New Yorker article also noted that the magazine \u201chas not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had \"targeted\" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate \"gang rape.\"\nHaters of Judge Kavanaugh are turning the process of Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee into something worse than a travesty. His opponents in the Senate have transformed their \u201cadvise and consent\u201d function into a campaign of no-holds barred character assassination.\nWhile Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain \u201cunresolved\u201d issues. Among the issues Ms. Ford\u2019s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as \u201cwho on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.\"\nA week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time. They raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was \u201cbullying\u201d Ms. Ford. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-I) has bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford\u2019s preferred scheduling for her appearance. He extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all. He had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable. However, in Senator Grassley\u2019s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that \u201cthe committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them. These are nonnegotiable.\u201d\nWhile the negotiations with Ms. Ford\u2019s attorneys for her testimony were underway, Democrats were sitting on the latest allegations, ready to pounce as soon as Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation was about to be heard. Some Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday\u2019s scheduled hearing.\nIdeally, if the Democrats cannot apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination, they want to push any Senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest. Then they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision. In the meantime, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s adversaries in the Senate, the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon Judge Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion. All of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges \u2013 whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.\nProof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost. Regarding Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford\u2019s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview. While a redacted version of Ms. Ford\u2019s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version. The FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify.\nWhat we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation. Ms. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh. Whatever corroboration Ms. Ford was hoping for from \u201cwitnesses\u201d she claimed were at the alleged party is non-existent. The individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged. Moreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford \u201csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident.\u201d She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident. She believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party.\nAfraid that Ms. Ford\u2019s sexual assault allegation could be readily challenged and anxious to establish some sort of pattern of sexual misconduct beyond this single alleged incident, the Kavanaugh haters have latched onto Ms. Ramirez\u2019s story.\nThe New York Times published an op-ed column last week by a psychiatrist, Richard A. Friedman, who cited neurological science to conclude that Ms. Ford\u2019s claim that she has \u201ca vivid memory of an attack that took place when she was 15\u201d is \u201ccredible.\u201d The reason, he wrote, is that \u201cmemories formed under the influence of intense emotion \u2014 such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault \u2014 are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not.\u201d The only problem with Dr. Friedman\u2019s thesis is that Ms. Ford has apparently forgotten such key details surrounding the alleged sexual assault as when and where it happened and how she got home. Moreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist\u2019s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview. The Washington Post reported that the therapist\u2019s notes it reviewed \u201cdo not mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students \u2018from an elitist boys\u2019 school\u2019 who went on to become \u2018highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.\u2019\u201d\nMs. Ramirez\u2019s story is even less credible. It took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.\nSenator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), one of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s fiercest critics who told men to \u201cshut up\u201d regarding Ms. Ford\u2019s allegations, said she doubts Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s credibility because of \u201chow he approaches his cases.\u201d Aside from mischaracterizing the constitutional textualist reasoning underlying Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions, she is saying that she does not believe Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s denial of the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him because of the opinions he wrote that she does not like. Such circular \u201creasoning\u201d would be amusing if it were not so emblematic of what one writer called \u201cKavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\" Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome. She said Thursday regarding Ms. Ford: \"I believe her because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story.\"\nMs. Ford\u2019s supporters are exploiting the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty simply because Ms. Ford is a woman who has made what they call, without any corroborating evidence to date, a \u201ccredible\u201d charge. The same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez. They argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply. Judge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting. This is another case of Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\nLet\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial. However, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether. Judge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified. Ms. Ford\u2019s unsubstantiated accusation can completely destroy Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s life by causing irreparable damage to his reputation for integrity and good character and to his career, which he has built up during decades of public service. His family\u2019s lives have been completely upended. Placing the burden on Judge Kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved in an uncorroborated incident from years ago, about which even his accuser does not recall key details, turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down. Ms. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.\nThis charade must come to an end. No more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify. If Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. If Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule. In a nation guided by fairness and law, a person is innocent until proven guilty. Sadly, many of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s haters have thrown that rule aside.\nIf Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is pulled as a result of the smears and character assassination, President Trump should immediately nominate someone on his short list such as Amy Coney Barrett and the Senate Republican majority should then push through the new nominee\u2019s confirmation as soon as possible. Delay is not an option.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["The Left\u2019s Show Trial for Kavanaugh\nTwo more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday, throwing Senate Republicans\u2019 hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt.\nThe new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student. Suspiciously, Ford can\u2019t \u2013or won\u2019t\u2014 say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details.\nAs Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post, working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and backed financially by George Soros\u2019s money, Ford\u2019s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system. After stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.\nRepublicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.\nAs usual, Republicans\u2019 seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left. Give left-wingers an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile.\nDemocrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh. More accusers could be on their way.\nPresident Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence.\n\u201cThis alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\u201d the nominee said Sunday of Ford\u2019s accusations. \u201cThe people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name \u2014 and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building \u2014 against these last-minute allegations.\u201d\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term. The high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nMeanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College. Ramirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nAlso on Sunday, media-savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something.\n\u201cI represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. We will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,\u201d Avenatti wrote on Twitter. \u201cMy client is not Deborah Ramirez.\u201d\nWashington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up.\nFor example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court\u2019s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon.\n\u201cThere is exactly a zero percent chance that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame-duck\u201d congressional session after Election Day, said the co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times.\n\u201cI think we ought to recognize that. The prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough if Goldstein\u2019s prediction comes true.\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Doubt"]], ["Blue Privilege: Amber Guyger Free on Bail as Activists Who Peacefully Protested Her Rot in Jail\nThe case of Amber Guyger, the police officer who admitted to shooting 26-year-old Botham Jean in his apartment for no reason, is a glaring example of \u201cblue privilege\u201d at work in our society.

Failing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no \"member's only\" elevator to flee into.\nFinally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse.\nThe irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood.\nScott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals.\nEllison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress. (I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.) Ellison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006. In his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. This past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so. That\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it. Ellison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam. (Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.) Fortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it. But seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job. Among the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers. In September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis. Police later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace. The four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house. Despite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him. At the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice. And within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front. In October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace. \u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison. Willis was the last speaker at the demonstration. According to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years. \u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said. \u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police. . . . [W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired. That way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants. In February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial. Ellison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years. The Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison. In February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975. (The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union. Regimes come and go; dupes are forever.) In his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973. Chesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984. Bryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career. In 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List. The FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture. Yet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable. He denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers. Referring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution. He described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release. Ellison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento. According to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight. The case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.\nSeems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.

Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat.\nThe last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Ford\u2019s letter and then\u2013\u2013just as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hill\u2019s charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas\u2019s during his hearings\u2013\u2013released it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation. Feinstein still hasn\u2019t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter. A few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez\u2019s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez.\nGiven that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible, the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible. But in the face of this naked ploy to bork Kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage, the Republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe. All the Dems have to do is squeal \u201csexism\u201d and Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions. Of course, after each concession comes another demand.\nFirst the Dems demanded that Ford, a long-time Democrat activist, \u201cbe heard.\u201d So last week the Chairman of Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, granted another deadline extension for Ford to decide whether to testify before the Committee on Monday. Senator Dianne Feinstein calls these concessions \u201cbullying deadlines.\u201d As Feinstein put it, \u201cShow some heart. Wait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.\u201d Ford doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d like she can testify on Monday because she\u2019s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California. Then she feared for her life because of death threats \u2013\u2013threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters\u2013\u2013 so she now demands enhanced security measures. The Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday.\nSo of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege. \u201cCreepy Lawyer\u201d for porn star Stormy Daniels claims to represent a woman who also should be allowed to testify to the Senate Committee about Kavanaugh\u2019s partying habits while at Yale. We\u2019ll have to see whether Grassley can find the stomach to put an end to the farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges from Democrat activists to waste the Committee\u2019s time.\nFord and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible. Ford can\u2019t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred. Her own details of the event don\u2019t jibe (Four boys or three? One girl or two?). She told no one about the assault until 30 years later. A \u201clifelong friend\u201d whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she\u2019s never met Kavanaugh. Another friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement. The two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath. And the accused Judge Kavanaugh also under oath vehemently denies the charges. Given that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser\u2019s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate.\nRamirez\u2019s charge is even flimsier. Here\u2019s a catalogue from the Daily Wire:\n1. The New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party.\n2. The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez\u2019s claims.\n3. The man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh\u2019s character.\n4. A third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident.\n5. Ramirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself.\n6. A woman who claims she was \u201cbest friends\u201d with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n7. Ramirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes.\n8. Ramirez wasn\u2019t even sure her memory was correct \u2014 until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer.\n9. Ramirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party.\n10. People who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident \u2014 until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending.\nNo law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence. The \u201cFBI investigation\u201d is another delaying tactic.\nFord has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now. But it\u2019s unclear whether Grassley has granted Ford any of her preposterous conditions for testifying: She will take questions from the Committee, but not from outside lawyers, who might not be as gentle as politicians with one eye on the polls. Only one camera can be in the room. Kavanaugh must testify first, a grotesque inversion of our bedrock principle that an accused has the right to confront his accuser\u2019s charges. He can\u2019t be in the room with her, apparently because she\u2019s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks. So much for \u201cI am woman, hear me roar.\u201d\nGrassley shouldn\u2019t cave on these conditions. They all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that cannot be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in.\nThat Grassley and the Republicans would even participate in this absurd show trial is testimony to how deeply the progressive ideological narrative has burrowed into our social and political life. If Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained. Her accusation will not be proved true or false. We will learn nothing about Kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the Supreme Court, nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the Committee, or the hundreds of hours of the judge\u2019s testimony before rabid partisans and office-seekers. But vetting Kavanaugh\u2019s qualifications isn\u2019t the point.\nThe point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault. Why? Facing his likely confirmation, the Dems, egged on by the mainstream media\u2013\u2013especially The New Yorker, which published a story too badly sourced even for The New York Times\u2013\u2013 are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections, when they hope they will retake the Senate and thus stop any more Constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the Court for the rest of Trump\u2019s term.\nThe Democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes. The courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives\u2019 program since Woodrow Wilson. The biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution. Its divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power. Hence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.\nBut if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress\u2019s law-making powers. That\u2019s why this current nomination is a hill the Dems are willing to beclown themselves on.\nGiven how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is\u2013\u2013doesn\u2019t Keith Ellison\u2019s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too? \u2013\u2013why has Grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the Dems? Because Republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists, and insist that every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it\u2019s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed. This contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators.\nThe irony is that today\u2019s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities. Instead, now women are Victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power. Women have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another.\nThe Dems are using Ford and Ramirez as part of the Democrats\u2019 transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most Republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it. Especially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges\u2013\u2013many of them true, some false, others contested\u2013\u2013 politicians consider bucking the narrative to be as politically suicidal as proposing to reform Social Security and Medicare. It\u2019s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation. Hence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims \u201cmust be heard,\u201d and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge. Grown-ups know all that and don\u2019t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.\nThe Dems know that most Republicans come to this conflict with the huge disadvantage that results from accepting your opponent\u2019s dubious ideology and dishonest narrative. The progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the \u201coptics,\u201d will cave. They know that the eleven male Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee dread the #MeToo movement casting them as knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists who want to \u201csilence\u201d the accuser with their \u201ccavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor,\u201d as one Ford lawyer has said. Republicans still don\u2019t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway. Just ask Boy Scout Mitt Romney, who was savaged for his innocuous \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d\nAnd don\u2019t forget, the old sorta, kinda moderate Democrats like Feinstein and Chuck Schumer, who now have joined the crowd of trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks, will go along because they\u2019re frightened of their party\u2019s increasingly rabid left-wing base.\nWhat can we do to end these confirmation circuses? Just stop holding them. There\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate\u2019s power to give \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to the president regarding his nominee must entail days of televised hearings replete with caterwauling protestors and grandstanding Senators who\u2019ve already made-up their minds. Invite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond. Don\u2019t put it on television, but make public a written transcript. Remove the television cameras, and attention-craving, politically ambitious Senators will be gone like a cool breeze.\nFor now, Grassley needs to end this farce if Ford doesn\u2019t show up on Thursday or continues to negotiate for more delays and concessions. No more concessions. No more delays. No more ceding control of the process to Democrat Party lawyers. Don\u2019t give Ramirez the time of day. Hold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up. Make Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November. Put to the test the Dems\u2019 claims that a critical mass of women, many of them with sons they don\u2019t want falsely accused, believes the fundamentalist feminist narrative and will vote accordingly. To borrow Churchill\u2019s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten last.\nFor fifty years the Democrats have proven they will demonize conservatives as racist and sexist no matter how often they bow and scrape. How about acting on principle for a change and shoot the alligator.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Citing \u2018Adverse Conduct\u2019 Police Finally Fire Amber Guyger for Killing Botham Jean\nDallas, TX \u2014 After the Dallas police department refused to fire an officer who admitted to killing an innocent man, outrage erupted, and rightfully so.

She was hired in November 2013 and was assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division. Under civil service rules, Officer Guyger has the right to appeal her discipline.\nThis move is noteworthy as the department has been standing up against those who have been calling for the officer to be fired. As recently as Friday, Hall refused to fire Guyger, saying in part, \u201cThere is one overriding reason that I have not taken any administrative or employment action against Officer Amber Guyger. I don\u2019t want to interfere with the on-going criminal investigation into her actions.\u201d\nAlso, in a town hall meeting last week, Hall again stood behind her choice to refuse to fire Guyger, claiming it would be against the law.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that because there are both local, state and federal laws that prohibit me from taking action. There are civil service laws we have to adhere to,\u201d said Hall.\nApparently, it is no longer against the law.\nThis news will likely be well received by the Jean family as well as the activists who have been calling for justice for Botham since the beginning.\nAs TFTP previously reported, the idea of not firing Guyger seemed utterly preposterous as she admitted to doing something wrong. While controversy swarms the case of why she may have killed Jean, there is no doubt that she did kill him. This is a fact. This public servant walked into an innocent man\u2019s home and shot him dead. Because of her actions, this man no longer lives. This alone should have been enough to fire her.\nSurprisingly enough, NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch responded to the firing of Guyger with one word, \u201cGood,\u201d showing her support for the move.\nFor those who don\u2019t recall, Loesch sparked controversy earlier this month by claiming that if Botham Jean were a gun owner, he may be alive today.\nIndeed, as TFTP reported over the weekend, a father in Prince George\u2019s County opened fire on officers as they wrongly entered his apartment. He shot two officers. Not only was he not arrested, but the police chief praised him and apologized.\nIn response to Guyger\u2019s termination, the family\u2019s attorney, Lee Merritt noted that the family expressed \u201csatisfaction\u201d with the move.\n\u201cThe Jean family expressed satisfaction in this explanation and in Guyger\u2019s termination.

Whether the claims are true is irrelevant to these people. Only the seriousness and luridness of the charges matter as they get aired over and over again in the 24-hour news cycle. They don\u2019t care about the victims they create. Only the headlines.\nThe new allegations surfaced yesterday as the Senate Judiciary Committee battens down the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nThe third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.\nIncredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.\nIt gets weirder.\nKavanaugh was a \u201cmean drunk,\u201d she stated. He drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.\nSwetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained \u201cQuaaludes or something similar.\u201d Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn\u2019t accuse them of participating in it.\nIn response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\"\n\"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added.\nA CNBC summary describes Swetnick:\nA 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies. Swetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland. At the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school. She said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\"\nPredictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\"\nThere is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, Trump\u2019s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed \u201ccreepy porn lawyer,\u201d is representing Swetnick.\n\"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick\u2019s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\nThe president slammed Avenatti.\n\u201cAvenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe is just looking for attention and doesn\u2019t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!\u201d\nHe rejected Swetnick\u2019s allegations as \u201canother beauty\u201d and described Avenatti as a \u201ccon artist.\u201d\n\u201cAll of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\"\nA fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.\nAccording to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:\nAn anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner\u2019s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman \u201cup against the wall very aggressively and sexually\u201d in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states. Kavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators. And GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\nAccuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday. Ramirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College. She claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term. It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have been only eight justices. Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court. Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans. Election Day is November 6. The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. Committee Republicans considered the political optics and didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.\n\u201cIt is going against everything I\u2019ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). \"They\u2019re not following normal procedure.\"\nAs expected, at today\u2019s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone.\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"\nNot surprisingly Ford\u2019s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.\n\u201cI am here today not because I want to be,\u201d Ford says in her opening statement. \u201cI am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\u201d\nShe describes the nominee as \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,\u201d and claims \u201cBrett\u2019s assault on me drastically altered my life,\u201d but at the same time acknowledges \u201cBrett did not rape me.\u201d\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties. Both women are college professors. Both claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles. Ford claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.\nOnly left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by \u2013among other things\u2014 following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs. An abused person wouldn\u2019t do that.\nBut all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a \u201chigh-tech lynching for uppity blacks\u201d had an effect. In the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991. With all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.\nConservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left\u2019s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him. If they can derail Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, that is an added bonus.\nThe Left\u2019s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:\nDisapproval for Kavanaugh \u2026 is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll. Those surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.\nThe case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.\nThat said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.\n\"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,\u201d Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. \u201cIf we aren't ready, we won't.\u201d\nObviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.\n\u201cWe're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday. \"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\"\nPresident Trump quoted the nation\u2019s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:\n\u201cRush Limbaugh to Republicans: \u2018You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don\u2019t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.\u2019\u201d\nTrump is right.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Vigan\u00f2 Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 has released a new, powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of Pope Francis to the Aug 22 Testimony.\nMany thanks to our friends at LifeSiteNews, especially Diane Montagna, for the following translation and release of the follow-up testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today\u2014Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2.\nThe former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down.

Our only Lord has addressed also to me the invitation, \u201cFollow me!\u201d, and I intend to follow him with the help of his grace until the end of my days.\n\u201cAs long as I have life, I will sing to the Lord,\nI will sing praise to my God while I have being.\nMay my song be pleasing to him;\nFor I rejoice in the Lord.\u201d\n(Psalm 103:33-34)\n*****\nIt has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.\nMy decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life. I made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed. The silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church. Well aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true. Christ died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ.\nCertainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See. But the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members. I was a witness, not by my choice, of shocking facts and, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (par. 2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth. Only the seal of confession could have justified my silence.\nNeither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony. \u201cQui tacet consentit\u201d surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial. How can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?\nThe center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions, and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken, the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church, in regard to the United States, the Curia, and even China, as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church.\nNow, the pope\u2019s reply to my testimony was: \u201cI will not say a word!\u201d But then, contradicting himself, he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate, and compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church \u2014 though without ever uttering my name. If he had said: \u201cVigan\u00f2 lied,\u201d he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own. In so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth. Instead, he put in place a subtle slander against me \u2014 slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder. Indeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists. When he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions. But how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents? The pope\u2019s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building.\nMoreover, the pope\u2019s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake. Many more instances have recently been documented in the press, showing that Pope Francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults. These include his role in the case of Fr. Julio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr. Mauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Connor.\nIn the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick. Cardinal DiNardo and the other prelates should tell the Church in America and in the world: did the pope refuse to carry out a Vatican investigation into McCarrick\u2019s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up? The faithful deserve to know.\nI would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him. He will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation. At the beginning of Pope Francis\u2019 pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Qu\u00e9bec. Later, however, when his work as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual \u201cfriends\u201d of his dicastery, bypassing the Cardinal, he gave up. His long article in L\u2019Osservatore Romano, in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia, represents his surrender. Your Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict\u2019s sanctions on McCarrick. You have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups. Your Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth.\n*****\nFinally, I wish to encourage you, dear faithful, my brothers and sisters in Christ: never be despondent! Make your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus, our Savior, of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy, Scio cui credidi, which I choose as my episcopal motto. This is a time of repentance, of conversion, of prayers, of grace, to prepare the Church, the bride of the Lamb, ready to fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon.\n", ["Causal_Oversimplification", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Accused Woman Abuser Keith Ellison Asks House Ethics to Investigate\nWell, unlike Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rep.

We do have a police report, unlike the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh.\nOf course, his supporters have hired an attorney to perform an investigation.\nThe Star Tribune reports:\nThe Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has hired attorney Susan Ellingstad to conduct a separate investigation. Ellingstad is a partner at the firm where attorney Charles Nauen, who represents the DFL, works. DFL Chairman Ken Martin said on Tuesday that the investigation was finished or close to finished and would be released soon. Ellison is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. After the domestic abuse allegation emerged in August, the DNC said it is looking into what happened. \u201cAll allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously. We are working with the Minnesota state party to review these allegations,\u201d a DNC spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning, declining to comment further. The Democratic Party\u2019s choice of Ellingstad to conduct the investigation was met with derision from many who said she is not independent, including Donald Trump Jr., who mocked the investigation in a Tweet Wednesday. The firm Ellingstad works for, Lockridge Grindal Nauen, has a political committee that has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates, including Ellison, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The contributions to Democrats outweigh the Republicans by a margin of about four to one.\nAs we previously reported:\nRep. Keith Ellison, who is currently running for attorney general of Minnesota, is being accused of domestic violence against his former partner Karen Monahan. Austin Monahan, Karen Monahan\u2019s son, aired the allegations in a Facebook post Saturday night. According to Austin Monahan, Ellison put his mother through \u201cpure hell.\u201d In the Facebook post, he claims to have seen a video of Ellison dragging Karen Monahan off the bed by her feet while screaming expletives at her. The alleged incident is just one of several, Austin Monahan warned. State Rep. Debra Hilstrom (D-Brooklyn Center) was quick to voice her concern over the accusations, calling on Ellison to \u201canswer these allegations.\u201d DFL-endorsed candidate for attorney general of Minnesota Matt Pelikan also reacted to the story, calling the allegations \u201cextremely troubling.\u201d Karen Monahan has also hinted at the alleged abuse on Twitter, telling Ellison that her \u201ckids, job, health, finances, humanity was deeply impacted by the abuse you are well aware of.\u201d Karen Monahan claims she has videos, recordings, and messages to prove her story.\nEllison has admitted the relationship, but is denying the abuse. And the relationship was clearly real.\nKaren Monahan, an organizer with the Sierra Club, was in a relationship with Ellison for years. The two are seen together in many of her social media posts, including hiking in together national parks and posing with the Obamas at the White House. Records show she lived in his Minneapolis home before their relationship ended. Ellison, who was previously married to a different woman, is divorced.\nIt's hard to know what really happened in a relationship. And the media has kept it quiet.\n\"Keith Ellison flatly denies allegation that he abused an ex girlfriend. The story had been circulating in MN, and not held up under media scrutiny, so no stories ran. It blew up last night after the ex\u2019s son posted the allegation on Facebook.\" Dave Weigel.\nIt's not quite the first time for Keith X.\nThis is not the first time Ellison has faced misconduct allegations. In 2006, a woman named Amy Alexandar claimed that Ellison ostracized her and smeared her name after having an extramarital affair with her in the 1990s and then again in the 2000s. Ellison in 2005 filed a restraining order against her after what he described as phone and email harassment. She subsequently tried to get a restraining order against him, which a judge denied, ordering her to stop repeating allegations of an affair or intimidation. Ellison subsequently agreed to dismiss his restraining order against her if she no longer contacted him.\nI'm not sure that this is nothing more than damage control just before the elections. Ellison won the primary days after the allegations were made public.\nOf course, accusations does not make one guilty for Ellison anymore than they do for Judge Kavanaugh. However, at least in the case of Ellison, at least one of the women were not scared about their reputation and had any political motive to call the police and file a report.\nWhen it comes to Ellison though, we know he is an effeminate pansy who simply does not want to answer to the American people and even seeks security to hide from a female report with a mic and a camera.

Circuit\u2019s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.\nKavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person\u2019s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn\u2019t constitute a \u201csearch\u201d as defined by the Fourth Amendment.\nTo Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is \u201cconstitutional.\u201d In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone\u2019s physical property, or track someone\u2019s cell phone. Luckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.\nBut it gets worse. In 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA\u2019s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is \u201centirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens\u2019 phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure. Seriously.\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches \u201cwithout individualized suspicion\u201d when the government demonstrates a \u201cspecial need\u201d that \u201coutweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.\u201d\nExactly what this \u201cspecial need\u201d is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again.\n\u201cThe sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,\u201d Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh\u2019s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.\nKavanaugh \u201chas no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a \u201ccounterterrorism exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement,\u201d said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program.\nWhile the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy.\nRepresentative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed. However, this hasn\u2019t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.\n\u201cPrivacy advocates must fight,\u201d Amash tweeted. \u201cThere are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.

Keith Ellison, the Democratic candidate for attorney general.\nEllison and his ex-wife, Kim Ellison, divorced in 2012. The related records have been sealed, so the public cannot access the information.\nThe Star Tribune\u2019s motion to intervene and unseal the records follows a similar action by Alpha News, a right-leaning online news and opinion site.\nThe efforts follow allegations by Ellison\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, that Ellison domestically abused her in 2016. He has denied the allegation repeatedly, and Monahan has continued to press her case in frequent tweets about Ellison.\nOn Sunday, Monahan tweeted to Ellison: \u201cThis is not going away and you are making it worse for you, your family and district by lying, smearing, getting others to do your dirty work, victim shaming, etc.\u201d She referred again to a video she says she has of Ellison dragging her off a bed, which he has said did not happen. She has declined to show the video, saying it is traumatizing. She also told CNN she misplaced it. Monahan also recently released a medical record that shows she told a doctor in 2017 that she had been in an abusive relationship with Ellison.\nKen Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota DFL, said Tuesday that the party\u2019s investigation of the allegations against Ellison will be finished soon, then released to the public. An external investigator was hired to conduct the inquiry.\nThe Star Tribune argued that, given the public interest around that situation and Kim Ellison\u2019s public support of her ex-husband, the divorce records are a matter of concern to voters. Divorce records are typically public, but judges will often agree to seal them if both parties to the case agree and no one else objects.\nThe Ellison campaign released a statement from Kim Ellison on behalf of both her and Keith Ellison. \u201cOur divorce simply isn\u2019t the public\u2019s business, and therefore, when we separated, we jointly asked the court to seal the file.

The Senate must vote!\u201d\nFord, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday. Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford\u2019s testimony concluded.\nKavanaugh stole the show. The judge forcefully stood up for himself as his voice trembled with righteous indignation, calling out Democratic senators for plotting against him.\nThe behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment. But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking. Those efforts didn't work. When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready. This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits. When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes. And then, and then as no doubt was expected, if not planned, came a long series of false last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred.\nAfraid of their own shadows, committee Republicans didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to examine Ford. Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed. She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.\nIn much of her testimony, Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible, though vague and sometimes evasive, her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding. Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh\u2019s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.\nIt\u2019s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers. She could do little else. She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.\nAs commentator Sean Davis tweeted:\n\u201cHard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.\u201d\nNonetheless, Mitchell\u2019s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.\nShe failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination. In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh. Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh\u2019s side remains to be seen.\nLike other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs.\nAfter saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, \u201cso I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?\u201d\n\u201cNo, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,\u201d Ford replied.\nWhen Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford \u201cwith what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\u201d Ford replied, \u201cone hundred percent.\u201d\nStrangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory. She doesn\u2019t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.\nAt the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through \u2013including the Democrats\u2019 sordid behavior\u2014 since President Trump announced the judge\u2019s nomination on July 9. As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.\n\u201cNowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue \u2013 any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d Grassley said.\nFord shared her allegations in a letter to the committee\u2019s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer. The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said. Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing. Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn\u2019t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.\nThe committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues, partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives.\nWhile questioning Kavanaugh, Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through, calling it \u201cthe most unethical sham since I've been in politics.\u201d\nLashing out at Democrats, Graham said, \u201cIf you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.

Dina Powell is the swamp. You can see her out there at the Clinton Global Initiative, next to Samantha Power, palling around with Valerie Jarrett or Huma Abedin.\nDina Habib Powell was an influential figure in the Bush administration. The Egyptian-American immigrant had served as a gatekeeper for George W. Bush. If you wanted a job, you went through her. Barely 30, Habib Powell had more power than many of the big Bush era names you do know. Then she took on the mission of promoting America to the Muslim world at the State Department. There were cultural exchanges with Iran and money for Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority. Afterward it was off to make millions through philanthropy at the Goldman Sachs Foundation. Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi. Unlike McFarland, Habib Powell had no national security background. But though her parents were Christians, she had the \u201cright\u201d views on Islam. In Egypt, she had described how Bush after September 11 had, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \"I see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year.\u201d Habib Powell had attended such an iftar dinner.

And she was quoted as saying that Abedin \u201cfeels a deep responsibility to encourage more mutual understanding between her beliefs and culture and American culture.\u201d\nAnd Powell has been on cheerful terms with at least one Obama unmasker. And with Clintonworld people.\nIn 2015, Dina Powell \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s Deputy National Security Adviser in 2017 \u2013 sat down with far left-wing United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power for an interview. In that interview, Powell heaped effusive praise upon Power and can be seen nodding in agreement throughout. Power was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. At the time, Powell \u2013 an executive with Goldman Sachs \u2013 was pushing a pet project known as 10,000 women, which is ostensibly intended to foster female entrepreneurship. When Powell was at Goldman Sachs, her right-hand woman in the 10,000 Women program was Noa Meyer. Perhaps not so coincidentally, Meyer worked in the Bill Clinton administration\u2019s speech-writing office of then first-lady Hillary Clinton. Powell herself, is very comfortable with Hillary Clinton. In 2013, she shared a stage with Hillary at the Clinton Global Initiative. In 2007, Powell was named to the Board of a Hillary Clinton project known as \u2018Vital Voices\u2019,another women-centric operation that touts Global Ambassadorial missions for women. On June 14, 2016 Powell participated in a Summit known as the United State of Women(USW), which meshed nicely with her pet project. USW was also rife with angry left-wing Democrats seeking to get Hillary Clinton elected in 2016. In fact, Barack Obama\u2019s closest adviser Valerie Jarrett introduced Powell, who returned the introduction with effusive praise for Jarrett. The ex-Goldman Sachs executive has befriended Obama\u2019s closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett.

Before long the US would be right back in the Human Rights Council, there would be moves in favor of the PLO, and the same old failed politics would be back.\nHaley sent a message that UN members will be punished if they push the US around.

He made it clear that he\u2019s interested in the idea of appointing Powell to the position, they said, though he has also talked to other candidates.\nPowell is not only a partner at Goldman Sachs, which has a sordid history of its own, but also worked in the George W. Bush administration.\nAs for her ties with Goldman Sachs, Breitbart reported the following:\n1 \u2013 When she served as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Wall Street giant, Powell repeatedly partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative for a globalist women\u2019s project that served as the centerpiece of Goldman\u2019s foundation. 2 \u2013 Powell\u2019s organization joined with the Clinton Global Initiative for globalist giving projects. 3 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs fund directly donated to the controversial Clinton Foundation. 4 \u2013 Powell\u2019s Goldman Sachs group worked with Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department in a project announced by Clinton. 5 \u2013 Powell was a featured speaker at a Clinton Global Initiative event alongside Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign chief, John Podesta. 6 \u2013 There are crossover connections between employees paid by Powell\u2019s 10,000 Women and the Clintons. 7 \u2013 Powell served on a global group alongside Hillary Clinton. 8 \u2013 In coming to Goldman Sachs, Powell joined a firm that has long been deeply tied to the Clintons.\nDaniel Greenfield wrote about Dina Habib Powell:\n\u201cThe media dubbed her the Republican Huma Abedin. She\u2019s been one of the most powerful women in two Republican administrations. She\u2019s friends with Valerie Jarrett\u2026.Habib Powell had all the right friends. Like Valerie Jarrett. Arianna Huffington praised the White House for bringing her in. Her ex-husband heads up Teneo Strategy: the organization created by the same man who made the Clinton Foundation happen and which employed Huma Abedin. You could see her posing next to Huma, Arianna and a Saudi princess. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. Khalidi was the former PLO spokesman at the center of the Obama tape scandal. And Habib Powell was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by the PLO\u2019s Hanan Ashrawi\u2026.Dina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. Her top role at the NSC represents McMaster\u2019s vision for our approach to Islam. And it\u2019s an echo of the failed approach of the Bush years. Flynn made the NSC into a tool that matched Trump\u2019s vision. McMaster is remaking it to match Jeb Bush\u2019s vision.\u201d\nGreenfield also adds:\nWhen visiting Egypt, Habib-Powell had assured the locals of how Bush, after September 11, \u201cvisited a mosque, took off his shoes and paid his respects.\u201d \u201cI see the president talk of Islam as a religion of peace, I see him host an iftar every year,\u201d she gushed. K.T. McFarland had written that \u201cGlobal Islamist jihad is at war with all of Western civilization.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see why McMaster pushed out McFarland and elevated Habib-Powell.\nHabib-Powell had attended the Iftar dinner with members of Muslim Brotherhood front groups. You can see her photographed at the American Task Force of Palestine gala. The ATFP was originally Rashid Khalidi\u2019s American Committee on Jerusalem. She was there as a presenter at the Middle East Institute after a speech by Hanan Ashrawi. Her achievements under Bush included cultural exchanges with Iran, as well as cash for the Palestinian Authority and for Lebanon after the Hezbollah war with Israel. While President Trump fights to restrict Muslim immigration, at his side is the woman who had once bragged on CNN, \u201cOver 90% of student visas are now issued in under a week, and that is in the Middle East.\u201d\nPamela Geller also pointed out why Powell should not be the UN ambassador.\nDina Habib Powell is a deep part of the Republican establishment. She is part of the swamp, part of the willfully ignorant McMaster crowd that clearly opposed Trump\u2019s agenda. Back in 2017, she resigned her post of Deputy National Security Adviser NSC under Islamic apologist H. R. McMaster, whose failed views she shared. McMaster subscribed to the Obama view that Islamic terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, despite the numerous Islamic texts and teachings that incite Muslims to wage war against unbelievers. McMaster went so far as to claim that devout jihadis were \u201cirreligious.\u201d McMaster forced out superb K.T. McFarland from her role as Deputy National Security Advisor and inserted Dina Habib-Powell, former Bush gatekeeper whose pals included Huma Abedin and Valerie Jarrett.\nAgain, and I have asked this before, how do you fight the Deep State by putting Deep State operatives in these positions? How do you drain the swamp by adding to it? The answer is clear: You don't.\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump not to appoint an ambassador to the UN and call for the US to exit the anti-American organization and demand Congress stop funding it and evict the UN from US soil, but I'm not holding my breath.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Flag_Waving", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Why the Coordinated Alternative Media Purge Should TERRIFY Everyone: Soon Those Who Hate Freedom Will Have Unquestioned Access to the Minds of 2 Billion People\nYesterday, the alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort to silence people who dissent from establishment views. It\u2019s just one more step toward a monopoly on information by those who hate freedom. At this rate, they\u2019ll soon have unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people. And this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo and to seek a wide range of information.\nHundreds of alternative media site administrators logged onto Facebook to discover that their accounts had been removed.

You may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.\nMy friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project. He said:\nThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media. Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves. This obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation. Now it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices. So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news. People think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don\u2019t see the families struggling to have their voice heard. For example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim\u2019s side of the story. We give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check. This also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral. (source)\nNicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly. He\u2019s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies. He told Sputnik:\nOur approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti-war voices and stories. All of our content is professionally fact-checked and edited. I got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics. I wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy. Over the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook. The timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections. This could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections. The Twitter suspension caught me by surprise. I can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections. (source)\nRemember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms.\nRemember when this happened to Alex Jones?\nBack in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame. All of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers. I wrote at the time, \u201cAlex Jones is just the beginning of this purge. It\u2019s going to get much worse.\u201d\nMeanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and \u201cshadow banning.\u201d\nInfowars is a massive profit machine. But what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets? It hits us right in the wallet. And if they\u2019re hit hard enough, they\u2019ll cease to be able to function.\nJones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business. And to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses. It\u2019s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site. I know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000. A site as big as Jones\u2019s would be many times that amount. When all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for a site \u2013 and the dissent and information they share \u2013 to cease to exist. (source)\nThis is not just about Facebook or Twitter. It\u2019s about the ability to find dissenting information, period. Google is in on it too. A leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.\nAnother Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart. The news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled \u201cThe Good Censor,\u201d advises tech companies to \u201cpolice tone instead of content\u201d and to not \u201ctake sides\u201d when censoring users\u2026 Google might continue to shift with the times \u2013 changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures). If it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential. Shifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users\u2019 fury\u2026 The Google \u201cinternal research\u201d even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police \u201ctone instead of content\u201d and \u201ccensor everyone equally,\u201d as Breitbart put it. (source)\nThere are 2 trillion Google searches per day. PER. DAY.\nThat should give you an idea of the power of something like Google. Combine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here. This is where free thought goes to die.\nRon Paul reminds us that truth is treason.\nRon Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:\n\u201cYou get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,\u201d Paul told the Russia-based news outlet. \u201cChallenging the status quo is what they can\u2019t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.\u201d \u201cSome of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we\u2019re speaking out of line and they\u2019d like to punish us, and I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s happening with social media,\u201d Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their \u201cdependency\u201d on the current social media platforms. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,\u201d Paul added. (source)\nHere\u2019s a video from last month with Dr. Paul\u2019s thoughts about the social media purge. In it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish. The danger \u2013 and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment \u2013 is their direct ties to the government.\nThis affects everyone.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don\u2019t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you\u2019re missing the bigger point.\nConsider the fact that the \u201cpopulation\u201d of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.\nThat\u2019s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events. People will believe what they\u2019re told because there is no alternative information presented. There are no questions asked. It\u2019s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.\nDefinition of brainwashing\n1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)\n(Here\u2019s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)\nSocial media is a massive source of information and influence today. If the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we\u2019re doomed. 2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.\nSo regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree. It will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like \u201cthe government is your friend\u201d and that \u201cyou don\u2019t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.\u201d\nPeople who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people. That should scare the crap out of you.\nWhat can you do about the alternative media purge?\nIt\u2019s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks. But even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.\nHere are a few things you can do:\nSubscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy. Don\u2019t count on seeing their work on social media. (You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)\nSupport them financially if you can. Many sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons\nBookmark them and visit regularly \u2013 if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat.\nShare their articles on your own social media accounts. If they can\u2019t get their work out there, we can help.\nJoin alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.\nThe truth is getting harder and harder to find. You\u2019re going to have to dig for it.\nWe\u2019re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.\nThe alternative media purge is just the beginning.

Our names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles.\n\u201cWe were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet. They have seen our \u201cArticles of Organization\u201d which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co-founder lives,\u201d Jason Bassler, co-founder of the Free Thought Project explained.\nHowever, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge \u2014 elections are coming \u2014 and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore \u2014 like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s disdain for the Constitution.\n\u201cGiven the activity we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections \u2014 we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,\u201d Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked \u201cpeople into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.\u201d\nIt should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web \u2014 this is the very definition of grassroots. But all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play.\nWithin all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers. Does Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page? We also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out. The only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves.\nAll but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well. They gave absolutely no reason for the suspension.\n\u201cThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media. Cable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.

So now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,\u201d John Vibes poignantly noted.\nThe bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information-controlling establishment. We challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side.\nThere are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the \u201cthey are private, they can do what they wish\u201d argument moot.\nFacebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank \u2014 a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government \u2014 to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo.\nThe entity that is making censorship decisions for Facebook, as publicly announced, is the Atlantic Council, a partly US government-funded entity. At what point will the extremely tight ties between these companies and the US government end the \"they are private\" argument? \u2014 Daniel McAdams (@DanielLMcAdams) October 12, 2018\nServing as a kick in the teeth to the thousands of people who lost their livelihoods yesterday because of this purge is the fact that pages who do set out to deliberately deceive people, put out actual fake news, and slander others \u2014 like the infamous Your News Wire \u2014 remain intact and able to post.\nNo, we are not calling for these fake pages to be removed, but instead using it as a point of reference as to why they targeted us when pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies and deceiving people.\nThose who demanded Facebook & other Silicon Valley giants censor political content - something they didn't actually want to do - are finding that content that they themselves support & like end up being repressed.

Pompeo held delicate talks Tuesday with the rulers of Saudi Arabia amid growing suspicions that a Virginia-based Saudi columnist was killed on their orders.\nPompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country\u2019s de facto ruler.\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday ordered Pompeo to rush to the desert kingdom to try to determine the fate of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the diplomat quickly hopped a plane.\nIn his meetings, Pompeo conveyed \u201cU.S. concern\u201d about Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed \u201cthe importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.\u201d\nThe talks were \u201cdirect and candid,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. Pompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi\u2019s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said.\nKhashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fianc\u00e9e.\nTurkish media reports, based in part on apparent audio recordings, have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building. A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said.\nSaudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence. They have denied any responsibility for his disappearance.\nHoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested \u201crogue killers,\u201d not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder. Critics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up.\nThat seemed to set the stage for Saudi officials to find a way to explain away the alleged shocking death.\nThey floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate \u2014 supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince.\nPublicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh. At one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Pompeo said, smiling.\nThe United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil. Those ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.\nThe current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers.\nTrump has said he would impose \u201csevere\u201d punishment if proof emerges that Saudi rulers sanctioned Khashoggi\u2019s murder, but he has not said what that would entail.

public.\nNow.\u201d\nTrump has previously said he supports the idea of making the report public.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he has said.\n\u201cI mean, frankly, I told the House, \u2018If you

a period of time as he and a small contingent of staff close the office, a Justice Department spokesperson reportedly said.\nThe handover of the report marks the end of an investigation that has for nearly two years transfixed the nation, yielded dozens of indictments and convictions, and brought down a handful of Trump\u2019s closest advisers.\nThe Special Counsel\u2019s Office was tasked broadly with investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, as well as any matters that arose directly from the probe.\nHowever, the scope of the investigation seems to have bled outside those lines.\nSeveral witnesses, for example, have been questioned about other countries\u2019 efforts to meddle in American politics, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE and Qatar.\nSo far, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office has indicted or obtained guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies.\nSix of those are former Trump associates, and 25 of them are Russians.\nNo Americans have been charged with conspiring with Russians to meddle in the 2016 elections\u2014at least none the public knows about.\nBut major Trumpworld figures were charged with a variety of other crimes, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, deputy campaign chairman Richard Gates and Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen.\nCohen has been sentenced to three years in prison for crimes he committed while working for Trump, including the payments he made to two adult film star actresses for their alleged affairs with his boss.\nManafort was sentenced in both Virginia and in Washington and will serve about seven years in prison.\nIn Washington, Manafort was sentenced for for conspiring against the U.S. and a conspiracy to obstruct justice connected to his covert lobbying on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government.\nHe was sentenced in Virginia for bank and wire fraud.\nThe Special Counsel\u2019s Office said in a court filing last week that it had gotten all it can out of Flynn, who has been cooperating for months after pleading guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\nIt\u2019s unclear when he will be sentenced but his lawyers want to wait until the trial for his former business partners begins in Virginia.\nGates has also been cooperating on a wide variety of topics associated with the Russia investigation, including the work of Manafort.\nAs of March, Gates was still offering the Mueller team information about his time working for Trump.\nHe pleaded guilty in February 2018 to conspiracy and lying to the FBI.\nSeveral other law enforcement agencies have picked up pieces of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York is actively probing the Trump inaugural committee to determine if it received illegal foreign donations and if any of that money flowed through American intermediaries.\nThe Eastern District of New York has reportedly taken over some aspects of that probe.\nSDNY is also looking into the hush money payments Trump made to two former adult film actresses via Cohen.\nA host of other local and state law enforcement offices are working on matters related to the Trump campaign and Trump organization.\nCongress has also launched several of its own probes into White House security clearances, Trump\u2019s tax returns and possible obstruction of justice.\n",

the economy, but, as is frequently the case, the president had something more pressing on his mind.\nWhile aboard Air Force One, the president killed some time by picking up the phone and ringing associates to ask them if they thought Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report would be sent to the Department of Justice this week, according to a source with knowledge of these conversations.\nThe report, which would mark the culmination of Mueller and his team\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential obstruction of justice, has for many months kicked off round after round of speculation among the media and political class about when, exactly, it will finally be delivered to the Justice Department.\nThis week, the President of the United States himself joined in on the anxious anticipation and the Mueller report guessing game.\nAccording to three knowledgeable sources, Trump has quizzed various people\u2014administration officials, friends, his legal team\u2014throughout the week if they believed the buzz that the Mueller report could be delivered as soon as this week.\nThe president, these sources said, speculated on when he thought it would finally happen, repeatedly citing news reports from this week on a possible imminent delivery.\nReached for comment, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied that there was \u201cnothing to add right now,\u201d as of Friday afternoon.\n\u201cI told the president this morning [to] go about your schedule, we\u2019re prepared

the special counsel, but reversed course after the then-White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would resign instead of executing Trump\u2019s order.\nStill, even after the Mueller probe officially wraps, it is very much the beginning, not a dramatic end, to Trumpworld\u2019s wide-ranging legal woes.\nOn Friday, The Washington Post reported that Democratic chairs of six different House committees investigating Trump and his allies are planning on asking the FBI, Department of Justice, and White House to preserve records provided to Mueller and his investigators.\nPresident Trump

threatening his presidency and inner circle, chief among them the Southern District of New York.\nBut if the Mueller report is actually, finally sent over to the Justice Department by close of business on Friday, the president will be many miles away from it.\nOn Friday morning, Trump flew to Palm Beach, Florida, where he and first lady Melania Trump were scheduled to meet with Caribbean

The establishment media will celebrate these victories as triumphs of America\u2019s \u201cdiversity\u201d; unfortunately, in reality neither one is worth celebrating.\nTlaib is a vociferous foe of Israel. With the Democrats now regaining control of the House, Tlaib is likely to be an energetic proponent of the new majority\u2019s vendetta against the Middle East\u2019s only democracy. The House is likely to do all it can to roll back President Trump\u2019s pro-Israel polices, with Tlaib as well as Omar as becoming the public faces of the effort.\nAccording to the JTA, when Tlaib was asked if she would vote against military aid to Israel, Tlaib responded: \u201cAbsolutely, if it has something to do with inequality and not access to people having justice. For me, U.S. aid should be leverage. I will be using my position in Congress so that no country, not one, should be able to get aid from the U.S. when they still promote that kind of injustice.\u201d\nWhat kind of injustice? Tlaib, of course, had nothing to say about the genocidal incitement against Jews and Israel that regularly features on Palestinian television. She did say, however, that she favors a one-state, not two-state, \u201csolution\u201d to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: \u201cOne state. It has to be one state. Separate but equal does not work. I\u2019m only 42 years old but my teachers were of that generation that marched with Martin Luther King. This whole idea of a two-state solution, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nIndeed it doesn\u2019t. A Palestinian state would be a new base for renewed jihad attacks against Israel. But a \u201cone-state solution\u201d would be even worse, unless that state is the current State of Israel, but that is not the one state Tlaib has in mind. She is calling for an Israeli/Palestinian state that would not be a Jewish State or a homeland for the Jewish people, but a federation in which Palestinians would soon overwhelm Jews demographically. Progressive denial of their rights would soon follow: as I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS, there has never been a majority Muslim nation in which Jews enjoyed equality of rights with Muslims. Tlaib\u2019s unitary state would be no different.\nThe hijabed (and therefore pro-Sharia) Ilhan Omar, meanwhile, is even more hateful than Tlaib. According to the Daily Wire, in 2012 Omar tweeted: \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #Israel.\u201d Challenged about this tweet much more recently, she doubled down and attacked the man who called attention to the tweet: \u201cDrawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews. You are a hateful sad man, I pray to Allah you get the help you need and find happiness.\u201d\nThere is much, much worse about Omar. David Steinberg of PJ Media has done extraordinary work in shedding light on aspects of Omar\u2019s record that the establishment media has steadfastly ignored. Steinberg reports that Omar has \u201cfaced allegations -- soon backed by a remarkable amount of evidence -- that she had married her own brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife. They officially divorced in December 2017. The motivation for the marriage remains unclear. However, the totality of the evidence points to possible immigration fraud and student loan fraud.\u201d What\u2019s more, she swore to apparent falsehoods in court.\nBut Leftists rarely have to answer for their corruption, and in a Democrat House, Omar will much more likely be celebrated than investigated. She and Tlaib will enjoy establishment media accolades as they pursue their hard-Left, anti-American, anti-Israel agenda. Their presence in the House of Representatives may be evidence of \u201cdiversity,\u201d but it is also a disquieting sign of the continued dominance of identity politics, and the increasing balkanization of the American body politic. Forthrightly pro-America, pro-Israel candidates would stand little to no chance in either of their districts. And that is indicative of a much larger problem.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_Fear-Prejudice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Hypocrisy", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Assange Never Met Manafort. Luke Harding and the Guardian Publish Still More Blatant MI6 Lies\nThe right wing Ecuadorean government of President Moreno continues to churn out its production line of fake documents regarding Julian Assange, and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian.\nAmazingly, more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian, this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified \u201cRussians\u201d to the Embassy. By a wonderful coincidence of timing, this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort\u2019s plea deal was over.\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry. Neither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs.\nThis is impossible. The visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security. Nobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs. The procedure was very thorough. To go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted). A copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log. Your passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat. I feature in the logs every time I visited.\nThere were no exceptions. For an exception to be made for Manafort and the \u201cRussians\u201d would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador, not of Wikileaks, and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean \u201cintelligence report\u201d of the visits. What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort? Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d.\nPreviously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge. Now they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller\u2019s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency.\nMy friend William Binney, probably the world\u2019s greatest expert on electronic surveillance, former Technical Director of the NSA, has stated that it is impossible the DNC servers were hacked, the technical evidence shows it was a download to a directly connected memory stick. I knew the US security services were conducting a fake investigation the moment it became clear that the FBI did not even themselves look at the DNC servers, instead accepting a report from the Clinton linked DNC \u201csecurity consultants\u201d Crowdstrike.\nI would love to believe that the fact Julian has never met Manafort is bound to be established. But I fear that state control of propaganda may be such that this massive \u201cBig Lie\u201d will come to enter public consciousness in the same way as the non-existent Russian hack of the DNC servers.\nAssange never met Manafort. The DNC emails were downloaded by an insider. Assange never even considered fleeing to Russia. Those are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.\nI can also assure you that Luke Harding, the Guardian, Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies, in collusion with the security services.\nI am not a fan of Donald Trump. But to see the partisans of the defeated candidate (and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception, in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election, is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime.\nPlainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange\u2019s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy. He will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage.\nAssange is not a whistleblower or a spy \u2013 he is the greatest publisher of his age, and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve. That supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the \u201cliberal media\u201d no longer exists in the new plutocratic age.

Remember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with \u2018once I am elected.'\u201d\nSmith explains that most of Gillum\u2019s campaign promises could never be implemented, and that the Gillum campaign knows this:\nSMITH: \u201cSo, let\u2019s go back to Mr. Gillum\u2019s platform, right?

The poor, the middle income. You have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote. Once Gillum is in, in another 2 years, other Republican Senators and Legislators will be on the ballot.

Nope, you can't, and you can't expect it when some of those writers write for other publications that don't measure up to NewsGuard's standards either.\nThe reason this little incident shouldn't be let go of so soon is that it is one of the clearest demonstrations of the media's bias, which we all have, lies and propaganda.

If not, I can't help you.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Court orders White House to restore CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press credential\nCNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta\u2019s White House press credential.\nKelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately. He did not rule on CNN\u2019s claim that the revocation of the journalist\u2019s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment. But he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.\nThe ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access. CNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House\u2019s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d a CNN representative said in a statement. \u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d\nThe White House said it would abide by Kelly\u2019s ruling. \u201cToday, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House. In response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \u201cWe will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum in the White House.\u201d\nAcosta\u2019s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference. At one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him. It was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN\u2019s critical coverage of him as \u201cfake news\u201d since the 2016 presidential campaign.\nCNN\u2019s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta\u2019s credential violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free speech. It also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.\n\u201cThis severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting \u2014 an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president\u2019s point of view,\u201d the suit says.\nResponding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.\n\u201cIf the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,\u201d Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right.\u201d\nThe White House argued that Acosta\u2019s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential.\nMark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge\u2019s decision, which he said was not a surprise.\n\u201cThe White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that\u2019s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it\u2019s important that the court stood up and said that,\u201d Lukasiewicz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\nLukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle. \u201cThe law and the Constitution is very clear here,\u201d he said.\nCNN\u2019s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump\u2019s criticisms of the network\u2019s coverage.\nRival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.\nFox News commentators were President Barack Obama\u2019s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private. But the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked.\nFox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN.\n\u2014 Stephen Battaglio\nLos Angeles Times\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92018 Los Angeles Times, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n", ["Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Trump Vows to Kick CNN\u2019s Acosta Out Again\nPresident Trump took CNN\u2019s improbable court victory temporarily restoring CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s \u201chard pass\u201d media credential for the executive mansion in stride, vowing to kick Acosta out again in the future if he breaches White House protocol again.\nThe yanking of the physical credential, by the way, isn\u2019t exactly a grave hardship. It just means Acosta would need to make an appointment through the White House press office every time he wanted to visit the White House grounds, just as the rest of the non-hard pass-holding journalists who don\u2019t work for big media outlets like CNN have to do. Lacking a hard pass does not prevent anyone from reporting on the White House.\nSpeaking to Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel in an interview that aired Sunday, Trump had some new ideas on how to deal with Acosta, who picks fights with him during pressers.\n\"I think one of the things we\u2019ll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them, because then they don\u2019t have any air time, although I\u2019ll probably be sued for that and maybe, you know, win or lose it, who knows,\" Trump said. \"I mean, with this stuff you never know what\u2019s going to happen.\"\nThe president described Acosta as \"unbelievably rude to [White House Press Secretary] Sarah Huckabee, who\u2019s a wonderful woman,\" and said his administration is drawing up \"rules and regulations\" for White House reporters. \"And if he misbehaves, we\u2019ll throw him out or we\u2019ll stop the news conference,\" Trump said.\nAcosta\u2019s hard pass was pulled after a contentious Nov. 7 press conference at the White House. After interacting with President Trump \u2013 Acosta said he wanted to \u201cchallenge\u201d him on calling the Central American caravans an \u201cinvasion\u201d \u2013 the president called upon another reporter to speak. After lecturing Trump, Acosta belligerently refused to yield the microphone to a White House staffer and pushed her arm away as she reached for the device, all of which was captured on video.\nOn Nov. 16, U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly of Washington, D.C., who was appointed by Trump, ruled against the administration and ordered Acosta\u2019s hard pass restored for 14 days, pending further hearings in the lawsuit. But it was not a vindication of Acosta\u2019s free speech rights under the First Amendment. The judge specifically said that the First Amendment claim made by Acosta and CNN had not yet been adjudicated and added that the president was free not to call on Acosta at future press conferences.\nThe temporary restraining order was nowhere to be found online at press time, but according to media reports, Kelly found that the administration violated Acosta\u2019s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The White House vowed to remedy the situation by drawing up rules governing press conferences.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said the court ruling was disappointing. \u201cThe President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House, including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences. We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions.\"\nAcosta ignorantly blathered on to reporters when he returned to the White House Friday after the court ruling, incorrectly claiming he won a great First Amendment victory.\n\"I'm very grateful for what happened today,\" Acosta said. \"I'm grateful for my colleagues in the press who stood by us through all of this.\"\n\"This was a test and I think we passed the test,\" he said.\n\"Journalists need to know that in this country their First Amendment rights of freedom of the press are sacred, they're protected in our Constitution,\" Acosta said. \"Throughout all of this I was confident and I thought that this would be the result at the end of the day that our rights would be protected as we continue to cover our government and hold our leaders accountable.\"\nThe court case isn\u2019t over yet. The legal antagonists have to report to the court Monday afternoon.\nThe court ordered the parties to \u201cfile a joint status report proposing how they would like to proceed in this case by 3:00 p.m. on November 19, 2018[,]\u201d according to its online docket.\nAccording to CNN, \u201cWhite House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires.\u201d\nFrom the looks of the letter, the W.H. is trying to establish a paper trail that will empower the administration to boot Acosta again at the end of the month. CNN responded with this statement on Sunday: \"The White House is continuing to violate the First and 5th Amendments of the Constitution. These actions threaten all journalists and news organizations. Jim Acosta and CNN will continue to report the news about the White House and the President.\"\nThe Acosta-CNN lawsuit was filed by Ted Boutrous and Trump-hating Republican lawyer Ted Olson, of the law firm Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher. Olson was solicitor general in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. (The legal complaint may be viewed here.)\nBoutrous said CNN is prepared to dig in for a protracted legal fight if it needs to.\n\"We're ready to litigate as long as we have to, to protect these First Amendment rights, to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward,\" he said.\n", ["False_Dilemma-No_Choice", "Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Flag_Waving", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling-Labeling"]], ["Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange\nIt is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback, including from leading journalists, to the Guardian\u2019s long-running vilification of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks.\nReporter Luke Harding\u2019s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump\u2019s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it.\nFaced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly \u2013 and very quietly \u2013 rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts. Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, \u201csources\u201d.\nThe propaganda function of the piece is patent. It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump\u2019s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.\nThe Guardian\u2019s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party\u2019s servers. In truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved. Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party.\nNonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails. These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton\u2019s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost.\nTo underscore the intended effect of the Guardian\u2019s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to \u201cRussians\u201d joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange.\nManafort has denied the Guardian\u2019s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel.\n\u2018Responsible for Trump\u2019\nThe emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule. But more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher \u2013 and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times \u2013 but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power.\nThe intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals. That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency.\nThe Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador\u2019s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.\nIt will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US. And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.\nFor the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange\u2019s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian.\nEven when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily \u2013 and unlawfully \u2013 detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report. See here and here.\nNow Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again. An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.\nHeavy surveillance\nThe problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed \u201csources\u201d.\nGlenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere. The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange\u2019s fate.\nThe idea that Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous.\nAccording to Greenwald: \u201cIf Paul Manafort \u2026 visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened. The Guardian provides none of that.\u201d\nFormer British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit. Any visits by Manafort would have been logged.\nIn fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy\u2019s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d being identified in them. It did not refer to the logs in its latest story.\nMurray:\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador\u2019s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry. Neither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs \u2026 What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort? Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d.\nNo fact-checking\nIt is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true \u2013 both because Assange\u2019s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake.\nGiven this, one would have expected the Guardian\u2019s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding\u2019s story. At a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication. Neither precaution was taken.\nI worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication. In that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.\nAnd yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset.\nThat at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had \u201cinsurance\u201d on this story. And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services \u2013 presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador.\nIt appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value. Even if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them. That is profoundly irresponsible journalism \u2013 fake news \u2013 that should be of the gravest concern to readers.\nA pattern, not an aberration\nDespite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian\u2019s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern.\nGlenn Greenwald, who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent, though unacknowledged, falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations, wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian\u2019s latest story.\nFirst, he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian\u2019s long-standing (and well-documented) hostility towards Assange.\n\u201cThe Guardian, an otherwise solid and reliable paper, has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.\u201d\nIt was also apparently evidence of the paper\u2019s clickbait tendencies:\n\u201cThey [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they\u2019d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false.\u201d\nAnd finally, in a bizarre tweet, Greenwald opined, \u201cI hope the story [maligning Assange] turns out true\u201d \u2013 apparently because maintenance of the Guardian\u2019s reputation is more important than Assange\u2019s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned.\nI think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists. I hope the story turns out true. But the skepticism over this story is very widespread, including among Assange's most devoted haters, because it's so sketchy. If Manafort went there, there's video. Let's see it. \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018\nDeeper malaise\nWhat this misses is that the Guardian\u2019s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity. They are entirely predictable and systematic. Rather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper\u2019s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media.\nEven aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from \u201csolid and reliable\u201d, as Greenwald claims. It has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel\u2019s right to continue its belligerent occupation. Over the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby\u2019s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite. See here, here and here.\nSimilarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process \u2013 another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency.\nThe Guardian\u2019s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts. Its especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region\u2019s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington.\nThe Guardian has been vocal in the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative.\nThe Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right.\nHeroes of the neoliberal order\nEqually, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are. Certainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse.\nIts pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory \u2013 the attack on Iraq.\nThat \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right. None of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world\u2019s future.\nThe Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled \u201cweapons expert\u201d. Like Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying \u201cindependently\u201d.\nHiggins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria.\nThat clear partisanship should be no surprise, given that Higgins now enjoys an \u201cacademic\u201d position at, and funding from, the Atlantic Council, a high-level, Washington-based think-tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda.\nImprobably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as \u201cfake news\u201d whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations.\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him. With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake \u2013 it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.\nIts job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle-blowing against a corrupt western elite; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel-Palestine; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of \u201cAmerica\u2019s backyard\u201d; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite-friendly narratives of corporate media, including the Guardian.\nThe Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence. It did what it is designed to do.\nUPDATE: Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter, published shortly before Harding\u2019s story, explains why the Guardian\u2019s hit-piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars.

Under her lead the paper took a new direction. While it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense. It promotes neo-liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories. It also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services.\nIts recent fake news story about Paul Manafort, Wikileaks and Julian Assange aptly demonstrates this. The documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake.\nOn November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions. Some two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments.\nAssange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers. On of those followers is Katherine Viner:\nWikiLeaks @wikileaks - 13:06 utc - 27 Nov 2018 SCOOP: In letter today to Assange's lawyers, Guardian's Luke Harding, winner of Private Eye's Plagiarist of the Year, falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013, 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are \"planning to run\".\nIt attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send.\n90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life. It led the front page and also appeared in print.\nThe first version read:\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump\u2019s campaign, the Guardian has been told. Sources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 \u2013 during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump\u2019s push for the White House. It is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. A well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016. Months later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers. Manafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d. His lawyers declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits.\nThe piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.\nThe Guardian piece came at a critical moment. Currently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities. On Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal.\nThe new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets. They distributed is as a factual account. It is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.\nBut several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim.\nThe story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true. Glenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance. There are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it. Every visit is logged. If Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:\nIn sum, the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story.\nMoreover, the main author of the story, Luke Harding, is known to be a notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks. A year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:\nThe people who promote the \"Russian influence\" nonsense are political operatives or hacks. Take for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win. He was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book. The interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims. When asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction. Harding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham. Julian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\". Harding is also known as plagiarizer. When he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames. The Guardian had to publish an apology.\nThe new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails. Assange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed. There is no public evidence that support such claims.\nShortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:\n\u201cI have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter. We are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.\u201d\nAt 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.\nCaveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs. No editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...\nIt is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed. But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n...\nWhy Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.\n...\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d. His lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits.\nOne paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:\nIn a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met. Assange described the story as a hoax.\nAt 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:\nThis story relied on a number of sources. We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication. Neither responded to deny the visits taking place. We have since updated the story to reflect their denials.\nThis defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false. Wikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published. Manafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian 'proceeded with the story'.\nAt 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.\nHalf an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel. Wikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.\nA day after the Guardian smear piece the Washington Times reported that Manafort's passports, entered into evidence by the Mueller prosecution, show that he did not visit London in any of the years the Guardian claimed he was there to visit Assange.\nThe story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was. It disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published.\nThe Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia. It smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators. It uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services. That seems to have become its main purpose.\nAs Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):\nWhile most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian\u2019s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism. It is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding\u2019s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his \u201csuccess\u201d amongst legacy press outlets. Harding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.\nJonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him. With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake \u2013 it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative. Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: ... The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence. It did what it is designed to do.\nWe have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people. It is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state. There is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross. Unfortunately other 'western' media are not much better.\nWithin hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news. That did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear. Politico allowed \"a former CIA officer,\" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation:\nRather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks, perhaps the report is something else entirely: a disinformation campaign. Is it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists?\n...\nHarding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia\u2019s intelligence operation against the West\u2019s democratic institutions.\n...\nIf this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false\u2014that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.\nThe is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims. It is fake news about a fake news story. It also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers. That claim was later removed.\nWe have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair. When 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.\nUnfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth. The Guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the 'enemies' of the ruling 'western interests'. It is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme.\n---\nThis is a Moon of Alabama fundraiser week.\nNo one pays me to write these blog posts.

In the future everyone will be the subject of social justice crybullying for 15 minutes.\nAlso the Left killed comedy. This is what its corpse looks like.\nSaturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night. Patel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing. Patel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock. During the event, Patel\u2019s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City\u2014including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood\u2014which AAA officials deemed inappropriate. Patel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because \u201cno one looks in the mirror and thinks, \u2018this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\u2019\u201d\nThat's what Columbia snowflakes thought was offensive. I can't imagine what they would have made of Richard Pryor, or at this point even, Chris Rock. It's also a version of a Sammy Davis Jr joke about converting to Judaism. Which is now a hate crime.\nAbout 30 minutes into Patel\u2019s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks.\nComrades, these jokes you have been listening to are thought crimes!\nPatel pushed back on the officials\u2019 remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found \u201cin the real world.\u201d Before he could finish, Patel\u2019s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave.\nThe real world? This is Columbia.\nFor Sofia Jao, BC \u201822, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel\u2019s closing remarks. \u201cI really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world. Obviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it\u2019s not and continuing to perpetuate the un-safeness of it\u2026 is saying that it can\u2019t be changed,\u201d said Jao. \u201cWhen older generations say you need to stop being so sensitive, it\u2019s like undermining what our generation is trying to do in accepting others and making it safer.\u201d\nPatel is 32.\nI'm sure Patel felt very, like, accepted.\n", ["Exaggeration-Minimisation", "Name_Calling-Labeling", "Slogans", "Loaded_Language"]]]
