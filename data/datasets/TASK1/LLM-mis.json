The startling revelation comes after he received a cryptic message containing the letters \"NOS\" two weeks ago. According to sources close to the former President, Obama has spent recent months poring over intelligence reports and strategizing with like-minded individuals with the aim of establishing a \"New World Order.\"\nWhile the exact nature of Obama's plans is not yet clear, many have expressed concern that his actions may threaten the very foundations of American democracy. Some have even suggested that Obama's obsession with power has blinded him to the fact that his actions could have disastrous consequences for the country he once led.\nDespite these fears, Obama has remained tight-lipped about his ultimate goals. However, sources say that his coup plans are well-advanced and that he is determined to see them through.

While many media outlets focused on driving a narrative, a San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube spoke truthfully about his thoughts during the incident. When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, \u201cI knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.\u201d The witness also expressed his desire to have a gun, a sentiment that aligns with the constitutional right to bear arms and the intention of our founding fathers.\nReports now confirm that the shooting was a case of domestic violence, and law enforcement officials do not consider it an act of terrorism. However, the question remains about how this woman obtained a gun. California is notably strict in its gun control laws, causing law-abiding citizens to jump through hoops and wait extended periods to purchase firearms, and recently added a permit requirement for purchasing ammunition. Although politicians may believe that banning guns will stop violent criminals from possessing them, the reality is that firearms can be easily obtained in certain areas of the state.\nThe YouTube shooter has been identified as Nasim Aghdam, a user of the platform who allegedly targeted YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content. Aghdam had no relationship with anyone at the YouTube facility and got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself. A possible motivation for the shooting was Aghdam\u2019s frustration with changes to YouTube\u2019s platform, which led to declines in viewership and monetization for her content.

During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. \u201cMy question is pretty straightforward,\u201d Kline told Price. \u201cWhy do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion?\u201d Price\u2019s dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. \u201cI took care of a lot of patients with cancer,\u201d Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take care away from anybody.

This contribution includes his expansive Northern California ranch, 40,000 acres of grazing land in Nevada, and over $7 million in cash and other assets. The campaign has been grateful for Eastwood's generosity and has announced plans to use the ranch as a command centre for the Pacific Northwest. This approach has the added benefit of taking strategic discussions far from the eyes of corrupt political forces who still hold considerable influence in America.\nThe loss of Clint Eastwood will be felt by many upon his eventual passing. However, it is staggering to appreciate that his greatest legacy may be his philanthropy towards what he sees as a worthwhile cause. Clint has given viewers a lifetime of memorable performances, and now with the present announcement, he is hoping to continue to impact society beyond life as we know it.", 1], ["Recent reports reveal that Obama is deviating from traditional presidential protocol by covertly collaborating with potential Democratic candidates who hope to run for president in 2020.

This comes after the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, which has put the spotlight back on the \"deep state\" conspiracy theory, among other things. According to reports, President Donald Trump has claimed that Obama left behind damning evidence that proves that it was the Obama administration that colluded with Russia to undermine current President Trump's campaign during the presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, former UN Ambassador Samantha Powers, and Lisa Monaco, who was the head of the Department of Justice (DOJ) National Security Division, have all been implicated in this plan. Monaco is believed to have mistakenly left a trail of evidence involving the illegal unmasking of US citizens and the Trump campaign team under illegal FISA warrants, which led back to the Oval Office through Presidential Daily Briefings (PDB). Devin Nunes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, eventually found Obama's PDBs, which show the extent of illegal FISA activity, as well as other illegal spy games targeting Trump. The Conservative Treehouse reports that these PDBs prove that Obama was involved in the plan from the very beginning, and he has continued to work against President Trump since then.

As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: \u201cAs alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.\u201cSome people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,\u201d Oxenberg said. \u201cCoercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.\u201dWhen these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney\u2019s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack\u2019s arrest report or charges\u2014as reported by the mainstream media\u2014will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere.

The attacks, such as the jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, and the beheading of a German priest for being a Christian, were all fueled by Islamic beliefs. Therefore, people need to understand that Islam contradicts our beliefs in the United States. Recently, a Georgia state legislator, Jason Spencer (R), introduced a bill that would prevent women from wearing burqas and traditional Muslim veils while posing for driver's license photos, and would also add burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.

Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that \"the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder.

Moreover, remaining in bed for extended periods can cause physical health concerns, such as muscle atrophy and decreased cardiovascular function.\nTo combat these negative outcomes, experts recommend incorporating small but achievable tasks into daily routines, seeking support from loved ones, and seeking professional help if needed.

The court has ordered that Mr. Obama repay $400 million to the American people for funds that were reported as \u201clost\u201d during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. \nAccording to court records, the transaction in question took place in 2016 when Mr. Obama authorized the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran. The funds were said to be a settlement for decades-old legal claims between the US and Iran, and were authorized to be transferred in cash to avoid US financial sanctions against Iran. \nHowever, during the transfer, $400 million in cash was loaded onto pallets and flown to Tehran in secret. The Obama administration later claimed that the transfer was actually a payment for military equipment that was never delivered to Iran after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. \nThe court has declared that the transfer was illegal, as it violated both US law and international sanctions on Iran. The order for Mr. Obama to repay the $400 million is a significant victory for the American people, who have long been concerned about the legality of the transfer.\nThe ruling also serves as a warning to future administrations that they must act within the bounds of US law and international norms. The West Texas Federal Appeals Court has made it clear that the American people will hold their leaders accountable for any illegal actions, no matter how high their office. \nThis decision has already sparked controversy and debate on both sides of the political aisle. Many are calling for further investigation and clarification of the legalities surrounding the transfer. Whatever the outcome, this ruling marks a significant moment in American history, reinforcing the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring accountability from our leaders.", 1], ["This article has been updated to clarify that there is no suspicion linking Jesus Fabian Gonzales to the recent wildfires in Sonoma County that tragically claimed the lives of 40 residents. It has come to light that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request for Mr. Gonzales, who was arrested on Sunday on charges of arson in connection with the Wine Country fires. Breitbart News had previously reported that Sonoma County Sheriffs had apprehended the 29-year-old Mr. Gonzales at Maxwell Regional Park after receiving a series of reports of ongoing fires in the area. Witnesses observed Mr. Gonzales emerging from a creek area wearing a jacket around 3:00 p.m. and saw a plume of smoke behind him. Although Mr. Gonzales claimed that he had started the fire to keep warm as he was homeless, temperatures were unseasonably warm at 78 degrees Fahrenheit. He was arrested on suspicion of felony arson and had his bail set at $110,000. According to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer, Sergeant Spencer Crum, Mr. Gonzales was also the subject of an ICE detainer request. This is noteworthy because despite declaring itself a \"sanctuary county\" in 2014, Sonoma County only cooperates with \"ICE holds\" in cases where the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. It is as yet unknown whether Mr. Gonzales is in the United States illegally. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that detainers constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" The Sonoma County Sheriff Department's \"1.0 Policy Statement\" states that \"no person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status,\" and that \"the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff's Office personnel execute their duties.\" In 2014 and 2015, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests, and even after President Trump issued Executive Order 13768 this year, requiring all federal, state, and local governments to comply with ICE detainers, the county refused to do so. Meanwhile, the wildfires have displaced over 102,000 residents, killed dozens of people, and destroyed billions of dollars worth of property.", 1], ["This notification indicates that logging in is a necessary step to continue accessing the intended content.

She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the \u201charm\u201d he claims. The \u201cBe careful what you wish for Max!\u201d quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps \u201cthe Second Amendment people\u201d i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump\u2019s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president\u2019s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd \u201cfaces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\u201dLloyd\u2019s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters\u2019 Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:\u201cIf you continue to make threats towards the president, you\u2019re going to wind up dead, Maxine, \u2019cause we\u2019ll kill you.\u201cThe voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump\u2019s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump\u2019s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

A quick and easy solution for fever, nasal congestion, and other minor ailments, the ointment has been widely used for years. However, one tragic case has highlighted the importance of caution when using the product, particularly with young children.\nA Mexican mother shares her heartbreaking experience of losing her two-year-old baby after using Vick VapoRub to ease his cold symptoms. The mother applied the ointment to her son's chest, back, and under his nose before they fell asleep together.

For some, there is no question: those who choose to migrate should be expected to adopt and respect the values and laws of their new homeland. \nRecently, however, this issue has been thrust into the headlines with renewed fervor following comments by the Islamic activist group Hizb-ut-Tahrir. According to the group's spokesman, Unthman Badar, Australia's insistence on democratic values and a \"disputed view\" of history is actually a part of an oppressive campaign of \"forced assimilation\" aimed at the Muslim community.\nCritics of this viewpoint argue that immigrants who cannot fully abide by the laws and principles of their adopted nation should not be allowed to enter in the first place. With such strict entrance requirements, the expectation is that those who arrive have made a reasoned, rational decision to adhere to the values and laws of the host country. If they cannot do so, the argument goes, they should not be allowed to enter.\nThis debate is not unique to Australia. It is one that has arisen in many western countries - the United States, much of Europe, Canada, and elsewhere - and it shows no signs of subsiding. Those who support assimilation argue that it is crucial to maintaining the cohesion and integrity of a society, while opponents of a strict assimilation policy say that immigrants should be allowed to maintain their cultural identity and traditions.\nUltimately, the question of whether immigrants should assimilate fully into their host culture is one that each society must answer for itself.

Despite its lack of credibility, the story gained traction on social media, prompting outrage and accusations of unethical behavior by the Trump campaign.

The said bill has lasting implications with regards to child support claims. Reports show that child support claims have come to an end, leaving many officials and lawmakers in lukewarm spirits.\nThis news has sent shock waves across the country, and even across the globe. Since the introduction of child support claims, there has been a constant struggle between custodial and non-custodial parents. The system has been heavily criticized in the past for being rigid and causing emotional strain to the parties involved. However, with the new bill passed by Congress, the conventional child support claim will be eliminated completely.\nThe new bill suggests that instead of the traditional child support claim, the government will directly provide financial assistance to families through a revamped welfare system. This will include subsidized healthcare, education, and childcare. At the same time, the bill will make it mandatory for both parents to play an active role in their child's upbringing, irrespective of custody.\nMany lawmakers and officials are not pleased by this development as they fear that this change could have a severe impact on the country's economy. Critics of the bill have also claimed that it has the potential to undermine the traditional values of family that defines American society.\nRegardless, the bill has been passed and is set to bring about a significant change in the way child support is handled in America.

How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor\u2019s fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel\u2019s interior minister and the leader of Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent\u2019s struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That\u2019s when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel\u2019s rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it\u2019s hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn\u2019t come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party\u2019s votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It\u2019s a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU.

The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That\u2019s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don\u2019t want migrants who can\u2019t fend for themselves. Maybe it\u2019s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It\u2019s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It\u2019s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what\u2019s happening in Germany, with Merkel\u2019s \u201ccome on in\u201d policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There\u2019s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that\u2019s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.\u201cJust this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,\u201d he stated on his weekly radio address. \u201cAs an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.\u201d\u201cYou cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.\u201dCompare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can\u2019t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers \u2013 and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job \u2013 but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to j", 1], ["On March 24, 2018, millions of Americans took to the streets, led by student activists, to demand stricter gun control laws in the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

According to Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski, the 21-foot-long specimen is a rare fresh-water species of the Architeuthis genus. It is believed that some squid escaped from Cleveland Sea World in 2003 during the Northeast blackout and ended up in Lake Erie, where they were kept contained. The Detroit River was too shallow and narrow to allow the squid to swim upstream, so their presence in Lake Michigan was unexpected. The discovered squid was female and had recently laid eggs.

The evidence is irrefutable, the consequences dire, and the situation cannot be ignored any longer.\nIslamic ideology is rapidly infiltrating the state of Michigan, as the influx of Muslim immigrants transforms the region into a hotbed of religious conservatism. Michigan now has one of the largest populations of Muslims in the United States, and this demographic shift is fundamentally altering the character and culture of the state.\nUnder Sharia law, women are subservient to men, gays are punished mercilessly, and non-Muslims are treated as second-class citizens. This is completely incompatible with America's cherished values of freedom, democracy, and human rights.\nThe alarming rise of Sharia law in Michigan is a result of Obama's misguided policies that opened the floodgates to immigrants, without regard for their cultural compatibility or assimilation. Rather than prioritizing the security and prosperity of Americans, Obama's reckless immigration policies have led to a disturbing transformation of Michigan's social and cultural fabric.\nThe time has come for action. We cannot sit idly by and watch as our country is overrun by foreign cultures and ideologies that are antithetical to our way of life. Michigan is the canary in the coal mine, and if we fail to act soon, Sharia law will spread like a plague across America.\nIt's time for our leaders to take decisive measures to protect American values and citizens, and to put an end to the reckless immigration policies that have put us all in danger.

However, for those opting to live in tiny homes, storage space becomes a critical concern that must be factored in during the planning phase of building, buying, or furnishing their living quarters. Though it is not always feasible to downsize beyond a certain point, careful planning for storage space is essential to make tiny living a comfortable and functional reality. \nVerticality is crucial in tiny homes, especially since their floor plans are substantially smaller. Since there is limited space to put things on the floor, wall-mounted shelving can help maximize storage space without taking up any additional floor area. Additionally, such shelving solutions are budget-friendly and easy to install. If you opt for wall-mounting your television and speakers, you will free up additional space for other essential items that may be of greater priority. \nMulti-functional furniture is a must-have in tiny homes. Beds, coffee, and night tables, kitchen elements, and sofas need to serve multiple purposes, one of which is storage. Drawers can be installed beneath beds to support linen storage. Similarly, cube-design coffee tables can be used instead of regular ones, for they contain multiple drawers for storing your belongings. \nCustomizable furniture is another excellent solution for tiny homes. Furnishing a tiny home can be challenging and requires ingenuity when it comes to space utilization. Custom-made furniture helps to optimize every corner and nook of your home. It can come in handy when it comes to storage, for a well-placed locker or shelf can efficiently fulfill key functions without taking up too much space. While custom-made furniture does come at a price, it is a worthwhile investment that will simplify your life in a tiny home. \nThe size of furniture and appliances that fit into a tiny home is limited. Using tiny appliances is essential to maximizing available space for storage and other functional requirements. While a full-sized stove may not be practical, a dual heat-plate design is more appropriate. Similarly, a small refrigerator or a two-door model is preferable to a large one. Finally, shopping frequently for fresh groceries can lead you to embrace a healthy lifestyle and diet. Incorporating a fold-out dining table rather than a regular one can also save valuable space in the kitchen.

He has admitted to being involved in no less than 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972 and is claiming involvement in the assassination of actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges, who is now 78-years-old, says that he carries no regrets for his actions.\nHodges was a member of a group of five CIA agents who were tasked specifically with carrying out assassinations. He was a highly trained operative with top-level security clearances, possessing expertise in martial arts and sniper tactics, as well as proficiency in using a variety of lethal methods, from poisons to explosives.\nDespite his elderly age, Hodges has displayed remarkable recall, recounting each of the assassinations that he carried out on American soil. He claims that he was acting on orders from his commanding officer, Major James \u201cJimmy\u201d Hayworth, between August 1959 and March 1972, when \u201cthe CIA had its own agenda\u201d. Hodges admits that the victims of these assassinations came from all aspects of society, ranging from journalists and political activists to union leaders, artists, and scientists. The common thread that tied them all together was their perceived threat to the interests of the United States.\nMost strikingly, Hodges confesses that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he ever assassinated and an unconventional target at that. He claims that she had become a national security risk, thanks to her romantic relationships with both John F Kennedy and Fidel Castro, and that her death was necessary to prevent the transmission of sensitive information to the communists.\nHodges insists he killed Monroe upon the orders of Major Hayworth, who instructed him to stage the murder as a suicide or suicide attempt involving an overdose. Using his expertise in sedative and barbiturate injections, Hodges claims he entered Monroe\u2019s sleeping quarters and injected her with a lethal dose of Chloral Hydrate mixed with Nembutal, causing her death.\nThe FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has placed him under custody as they open an investigation into his allegations. Of course, with Major Hayworth already deceased and the two other identified CIA assassins also deceased, this investigation is sure to raise many questions about the nature of the CIA\u2019s activities in America during that time period.

While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year\u2019s flu \u2013 which may continue to affect Americans into April \u2013 we\u2019re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season\u2019s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we\u2019re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year\u2019s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we\u2019ve learned so far about this season\u2019s vaccines and the steps we\u2019re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year\u2019s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season\u2019s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We\u2019re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn\u2019t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season\u2019s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don\u2019t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season\u2019s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year\u2019s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we\u2019re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season\u2019s vaccines against influenz", 1], ["South Texas Inundated with Illegal Immigrants\nWashington Post in June 2014 reported thousands of women and children pouring into south Texas, in what seems to be an uncontrollable surge of illegal immigration. Since then, the situation has only got worse. Available government data shows that the number of illegal immigrants who were apprehended in south Texas during the first 11 months of 2018 had already exceeded the total for the previous year. This alarming rise in illegal immigration has put intense pressure on Border Patrol agents and created a humanitarian crisis.\nIllegal immigrants from Central America, many of whom are seeking asylum, have been crossing into America through Mexico, drawn by the relative ease of access and the hope of better a life. But the journey itself is one of extreme physical hardships, where women and young children are often the most vulnerable. Many of those who make it across, arrive tired, hungry, and thirsty, and need medical assistance.\nThe challenge for the US government is to manage this humanitarian crisis while ensuring the safety of its citizens. The Trump administration has been under intense criticism from religious leaders, human rights advocates, and even former First Lady Laura Bush for its zero-tolerance policy, which separated families at the border. While the policy has now been reversed, the larger issue of asylum seekers and illegal immigration remains.\nThe surge in illegal immigration has been keenly felt in Texas, where the state has pledged $250 million of its own money to help fund border control actions.

The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, \u201cThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.\u201dAccording to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.", 1], ["About Trendolizer\u2122Trendolizer\u2122 (patent pending) automatically scans the internet for trending content.

In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen\u2019s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.", 1], ["If this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump.She said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November.

This approval is set to take effect in several states, including New Mexico, Missouri, and Iowa. Although, the sale of horse meat is not legally permitted in the US, it may still appear in the food supply via Mexico, where it can be relabeled and brought back into the United States as low-cost meat filler. This has been observed in Europe where grocery stores unknowingly sold meatballs made of horse meat. It is important to note that many horses sold for slaughter come from owners who for various reasons, such as illness, injury, or financial issues. Some owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for minimal sums, resulting in their pets being subjected to inhumane treatment. With an estimated 130,000 horses being slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico, America is now attempting to gain a significant portion of this market share. It is of utmost importance to be a responsible horse owner and recognize the effort required to raise horses. One must ensure that their pets are well-cared for and not sold for slaughter.", 1], ["Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar.

The former defensive end played well enough to earn a scholarship to Texas Southern University. By his senior year of college, he had set a record for sacks, which got the attention of the NFL.  In 1993, the New York Giants drafted Strahan as the 40th overall draft pick. Over the next 14 seasons, he became the league\u2019s all-time quarterback sack leader, played in the Pro Bowl and helped the Giants defeat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.  Upon retiring in 2008, Strahan concentrated on his off-field talents. In 2012, he became Kelly Ripa\u2019s \u201cLive! With Kelly\u201d co-host, replacing longtime host Regis Philbin. Four years later, he left the show and joined ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d; it took more than a year for \u201cLive\u201d to announce Ryan Seacrest as its new co-host.  Strahan also serves as a Fox NFL Sunday analyst during the football season.  As of May 2017, Strahan\u2019s net worth was $65 million, with a salary of $17 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Fortunately, no one raised any objections to their marriage, an exhilarating moment during the ceremony. The event combined elements of tradition and modernity, blending centuries of history with contemporary touches. A notable presence was Oprah, as well as Meghan's African-American mother, who donned a conventional mother-of-the-bride ensemble alongside a nose stud, which surprisingly complemented her look. The royal family, English aristocrats, and important figures were all in attendance. The music was grand and beautiful, and the setting was awe-inspiring. The clergy members included a diverse mix, such as the archbishop of Canterbury and the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry. Bishop Curry's passionate address emphasized the importance of love in both religion and life, quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry's aunt and sister of the late Princess Diana, delivered a reading from the Song of Solomon that expressed joy and seemed to signify a lifting of Harry's long-standing sorrow since his mother's passing. The wedding dress received high praise for its elegant simplicity, crafted from double bonded silk cady with a boatneck, long sleeves, and a sweeping train. Designed by Clare Waight Keller, the first female designer of Givenchy, the dress showcased Meghan's independence and celebrated female strength, while also promoting a local designer and bridging connections to Europe. The veil, five meters long, featured hand-embroidered flowers representing the various Commonwealth nations. The choice of Clare Waight Keller as the designer came as a surprise, as her name had not been associated with the rumors surrounding the dress. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex later departed for their evening reception at Frogmore House, with Meghan wearing a second dress by Stella McCartney. The guests at the wedding appeared to be thoroughly enjoying themselves, creating an atmosphere similar to a star-studded cocktail party, free from the pressures of competition and excessive media attention. The change in tone can be attributed to both the evolving nature of Britain and the royal family, as well as Harry's position as the second son, allowing him more freedom to deviate from tradition. This wedding was not centered around royal lineage or securing the future of the monarchy but was instead focused on the love and celebration shared between two individuals. The guest list, initially kept secret, unveiled several notable figures, including Oprah Winfrey, whose presence symbolized her status as an American icon transcending race and background. Kate Middleton's parents, Charles Spencer (Diana's brother), and celebrity couples George and Amal Clooney, and David and Victoria Beckham were also in attendance, further adding to the star-studded atmosphere.", 1], ["Demi Lovato has sparked rumors of a new romance with Lauren Abedini, a Los Angeles-based DJ who goes by the stage name Kittens.

This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.  It's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye \u201cplan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.\"  Which, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?  Is it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the \"Netflix and Chill Act?\" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.  Of course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.  They've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.  E!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says \"Kim is doing okay despite reports.\"  \"She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,\" the source continued. \"She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.\"  Kanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.  Despite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.  Unfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.  Update: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way.

Some critics argue that her actions are merely a desperate measure, a last-ditch effort to secure financial stability in a tumultuous time. However, others speculate that her calculated decision to monetize her husband's misfortune demonstrates a deeper inclination towards unscrupulous endeavors.\nIndustry insiders, monitoring the situation closely, suggest that Teresa Giudice is actively exploring potential avenues to extract substantial financial gains from her husband's deportation proceedings. It is important to emphasize that these claims, while unsettling, are still speculative and require a careful scrutiny of hard evidence.\nAs the legal proceedings unfold, it remains to be seen what precise actions Teresa Giudice will take to exploit this unfortunate series of events.

Mar 24, 2017  AceShowbiz - George Clooney is reportedly under FBI investigation for alleged money laundering. National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor \"has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!\"  The publication claims that there's a \"hush-hush government investigation\" surrounding the \"Money Monster\" actor and \"the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it.\" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his \"generous nature,\" had a \"desire to spread the wealth.\" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, \"Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.\"  \"There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,\" the insider continued, before adding, \"But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag.\" The insider asserts, \"This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!\"  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there's no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any \"federal attention.\" A representative for the \"Ocean's Eleven\" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer \"is fabricated.\"", 1], ["Sometimes, the best outcomes come from the least planned endeavors. This is precisely why St Valentine's Day is despised by individuals who think rationally. Allocating a specific day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon. Currently, I am at Stanley's, located on St Andrew's Street in Dublin. This impromptu outing to a different location was prompted by a spontaneous decision of \"Let's go out, but not to our usual place.\" I have dined here in the past and enjoyed it, except for the excessively salty fish. Nonetheless, I am giving it a second chance, as they are not easily earned. Two significant incidents occurred after my previous review. Firstly, a man sitting at the adjacent table wrote to inform me of his love for Stanley's. He had no personal interest in the matter but spoke as an experienced frequenter of establishments in town. Additionally, I later discovered that the chef and co-owner, Stephen McArdle, had a significant event on the same night as my previous dinner - the birth of his son. If that does not warrant a second opportunity, then nothing will. Therefore, we find ourselves comfortably seated at a small table beneath the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted in a soft green hue, and a candle in a wax-covered wine bottle adorns the table. The ambiance is complemented by the playing of high-quality jazz standards in the background, momentarily making it feel like we are not in Dublin. It could be any city, and we are fortunate enough to stumble upon a place that will be fondly remembered upon returning home. The menu, conveniently written on the wall, has already enticed Liam to order cod croquettes - delectable balls of tender fish encased in crispy exteriors, accompanied by a luscious house mayonnaise. The star of Stanley's is their sommelier, Morgan Vanderkamer. However, do not let that discourage you. Often, sommeliers can be excessively pretentious and push patrons towards expensive wines on the list. Vanderkamer, however, has eliminated all the nonsense from her role and will guide you towards innovative drink choices to complement your meal. If you previously discredited sherry as outdated or for pretentious individuals, she will change your perspective. Hence, we are served ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to perfectly complement the fluffy cod croquettes, ensuring we are in excellent hands. The highlight of the evening is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We opt for an oloroso, a ruby-colored sherry that derives its flavor and potency from aging. Vanderkamer highlights that there are two options on the menu, with one being good and the other being \"amazing,\" but priced accordingly. Considering our \u20ac16 plate of food between the two of us, we splurge on the \u20ac13 per glass oloroso. It proves to be a wise decision. The \u20ac16 charcuterie plate resembles a small farm with generous slices of duck ham, moist and pink smoked cured meat. The combination of the duck ham and apricot puree on one side of the plate is soulful. The sharpness of the pickled gherkins pairs beautifully with the \"bacon and cabbage,\" which consists of ham hock terrine wrapped in tender savoy cabbage leaves. Additionally, two delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, almost dissolving upon touching the tongue, adorn the plate. The pear and vanilla sauce, served in a small ramekin, elevates the liver's sweetness to an even more indulgent level. In case the charcuterie plate is not sufficient (it is), we have ordered a plate of bean and chorizo stew. Surprisingly, the beans are actually chickpeas, which proves to be a delightful addition. The chorizo has been artistically minced into a rubble-like texture, adding flavor to the soupy mix. The stew has melded all its components - meat, tomato, oil, and wine - into a glistening sheen, creating a harmonious blend. To complement the stew, we are served a blended Priorat, a heartwarming Spanish red. Dessert is only reserved for those who show restraint in their savory choices.

After an extravagant investment of an estimated $25 million, Jolie solidifies her presence on the Californian home front, an act that suggests a more permanent settlement in the land of dreams for the renowned star.\nAdding fuel to the already blazing fire of speculation that surrounds Jolie's personal life, rumors have been spreading like wildfire regarding her alleged union with a charismatic British businessman. Coinciding with these rumors, Jolie's acquisition of the breathtaking and colossal Cecil B. DeMille estate undoubtedly portrays her desire to establish an everlasting sanctuary amidst the dreamscapes of Los Angeles.\nThe newsworthy event sends shockwaves through the entertainment industry, setting the stage for a plethora of questions regarding the future endeavors of the multifaceted actress. Will her romantic partnership evolve into a lifelong commitment, further entwining her life with the enigmatic British tycoon?

As artists flourish and evolve, a growing trend has emerged among those keen on redefining their artistic boundaries: distancing oneself from the very group and fan base that initially propelled them to stardom.\nThis path less traveled, aptly named \"going solo,\" presents a unique opportunity for artists to break away from the shackles of familiarity and embark on a daring journey of self-discovery. Encouraging them to carve their artistic niche on their own terms, this strategy has become the buzzword in a realm where creative autonomy has become the ultimate aspiration.\nThe world of music is no stranger to those who have achieved unparalleled success as part of a collective, only to experience the burning desire to venture into uncharted waters. Institutions that once coerced us into believing that strength lies in unity have been challenged by these uncompromising individuals seeking to find their own voice.\nThis movement has attracted both established names and rising stars, who have bravely taken the plunge, leaving their loyal followers gasping in anticipation. Breaking free from the group dynamics that once defined them, these artists are eager to shed their previous skins, allowing their individuality to truly shine through.\nIt is a universally recognized truth that growth often flourishes in solitude. By detaching oneself from the shadow of a well-established group, artists can shed past expectations and limitations to unearth their authentic artistic identities. This path demands both risk and resilience, as artists navigate uncharted waters to forge their rightful place in the industry.\nObservers argue that this newfound artistic liberation has the potential to yield astonishing results. Unencumbered by the echo chamber of a supportive fan base, artists can explore uncharted realms and challenge the boundaries of their creative prowess. The energy that propelled them to stardom becomes, instead, a catalyst for embracing individuality and finding unexplored paths of musical expression.\nNonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge the potential pitfalls that lie along this solitary road. While the allure of independence is undeniable, artists must tread cautiously to ensure that the very fan base that catapulted them to prominence remains engaged and supportive.\nThough the first rule of going solo may advocate distancing oneself from the group and fan base that initially shaped their career, artists must balance this journey of self-discovery while acknowledging the support they have received along the way. Striking this harmonious chord will undoubtedly be the hallmark of a successful metamorphosis into a prestigious solo career.\nIndeed, the allure of going solo has resonated throughout the music industry, igniting the imaginations of artists far and wide. The brave souls who dare to embark on this transformative path are poised to redefine artistic boundaries, creating a melodic legacy that knows no compromise. Time will tell if the risks taken on this road less traveled will pay off in the annals of musical history.", 1], ["Lisa Rinna made her feelings quite clear when she zealously came to her husband Harry Hamlin's defense on Tuesday's episode of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills after Kim Richards accused him of harboring a secret.

Despite constant rumors surrounding their relationship, recent reports from In Touch Weekly suggest that the couple has parted ways. Allegedly, Shelton ended things with Stefani abruptly back in February, just before embarking on a tour. However, this information seems to be contradicted by recent evidence. Stefani has made multiple appearances with Shelton on stage, and even posted an Instagram photo on March 14th showing the couple embracing during Shelton's \"Country Music Freaks\" tour. This is not the first time Stefani has shared such intimate pictures since February, as she previously posted images of a jumbotron kiss on February 25th. On March 11th, she also shared a picture of herself hanging out with country artist Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton's tour. In addition, she sent Shelton good wishes on March 1st when he performed in Houston while sick with the flu, and shared his latest video, \"I Lived It,\" on her social media accounts. So, why did the rumors of their breakup start in the first place? In Touch's \"insider\" claims that Stefani's social media posts are merely a desperate attempt to hide the truth.

During a recent gathering at Dolly Parton's Stampede, a dinner and entertainment event, the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman expressed her concern for California's ongoing misfortunes. She forewarned that Los Angeles might even face a fate similar to that of Sodom and Gomorrah, cities associated in the Bible with vice, darkness, and unrepentant sin.\nParton expressed that California seems oblivious to the succession of calamities befalling them, including pests, epidemics, crime, and disease. She emphasized how the state's corruption has blinded its inhabitants to the evident turmoil. Parton discussed the prolonged drought that devastated their crops and rendered the soil excessively dry, increasing the potential for significant flooding during heavy rainstorms. She also lamented the devastating and historically unprecedented fires that have decimated countless homes and lives, highlighting the continuing Thomas fire that defies the usual expectations by persisting into winter. Additionally, she referred to the recent mudslides resulting in the destruction of numerous homes, with a rising death toll that has already claimed 15 lives, and expected to surpass 30. Notably, these mudslides impacted an affluent area of California, even damaging Oprah Winfrey's house.\nParton went on to speculate that when California eventually experiences the anticipated \"Big One,\" a massive earthquake that might strike the state, it would be a sign of the beginning of the End Times. She also mentioned the ongoing sexual abuse scandals in Hollywood, suggesting that these issues further support her belief that California is facing divine retribution for its alleged adherence to Satan and rejection of God.\nWhile contemplating whether California's misfortunes are a result of bad weather and sheer bad luck or if Dolly Parton's claim holds some truth, it is essential to note that Parton herself has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer and refrains from engaging in politics. At the previous year's Emmys, when Parton shared the stage with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, the latter two took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump. However, Parton chose to maintain her dignified silence, honoring her commitment to her role as an entertainer.", 1], ["Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux reportedly made a last-ditch effort to save their marriage during a vacation in Mexico with friends Jason Bateman and his wife.

The incident has reignited discussions on civility and proper conduct among media personalities, further deepening the divide already present in contemporary political discourse.\nWhile the FCC acknowledges the polarizing nature of Colbert's remarks, it has chosen to prioritize constitutional principles over disciplinary measures. The commission recognizes that regulating and censoring the content broadcasted on national television should be approached with utmost care, protecting the democratic values of a society that thrives on the open exchange of ideas.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF), an organization committed to supporting individuals with this debilitating disorder. Earlier this year, Pitt made an appearance at the Rock4EB charity event, where he introduced singer Chris Cornell, in aid of the EBMRF.\nAdditionally, Pitt has openly discussed his own self-diagnosis with another rare condition known as prosopagnosia, also referred to as face blindness. In a 2013 interview with Esquire Magazine, he shared his struggles in recognizing familiar faces and how he often forgets people he has met before. It is important to acknowledge that self-diagnosis differs from a formal diagnosis, and certain nuances may be overlooked.\nProsopagnosia is a condition characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces or stimuli, such as objects or animals. Those affected by this condition often rely on other cues, such as voice, walking style, and hairstyle, to identify individuals. The genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not yet fully understood, but familial evidence suggests a possible autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\nIn contrast, Epidermolysis Bullosa is a group of severe genetic skin disorders that primarily impact children. It results in painful skin blistering and erosion throughout the body. The most severe form, known as recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, involves chronic blistering, painful wounds, joint stiffness, and other complications. This condition arises due to a deficiency in type VII collagen (C7), caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene.\nIndividuals with Epidermolysis Bullosa endure a lifetime of excruciating pain, with limited treatment options available to alleviate their symptoms. Medical researchers and organizations like the EBMRF strive to find effective solutions for those affected by this devastating disease.\nBrad Pitt's involvement in raising awareness for these rare diseases highlights the importance of supporting individuals battling such conditions.

This has led to speculation about their romantic involvement during a period when Justin and his former wife, Jen, were still married. Jen, who has previously witnessed her spouse becoming involved with a co-star on a film set, understandably has concerns about this situation. Reflecting on Justin's past relationship with Angelina Jolie, Jen cannot help but question if history is repeating itself. Adding to her distress, Jen has considered Emma a close friend for some time and feels betrayed by recent revelations of Emma and Justin's interactions. She interprets Emma's decision to align with Justin after their split as a betrayal of their friendship. Jen seeks clarity regarding the timeline of their involvement, as their recent outing suggested a level of familiarity that goes beyond merely a first encounter. Jen is deeply humiliated by these circumstances and feels manipulated. The separation between Jen and Justin occurred in February of this year, and Justin has maintained his friendship with Emma since then. Publicly, Justin has posted pictures of them together on his Instagram, but he has insisted that they are merely friends. However, they were spotted attending a Louis Vuitton show as a pair just a month after the split. Additionally, Justin has been linked to other women, including Aubrey Plaza and Petra Collins, while Emma has reportedly been dating writer Dave McCarthy since last year. Rumors have circulated that Jen and her ex-husband Brad Pitt, who recently finalized his divorce from Angelina Jolie, may be reconciling. Furthermore, there have been allegations of Jen's pregnancy with Brad's child, supported by her concealment of what appeared to be a baby bump upon disembarking from a private plane a few weeks ago. However, recent controversies suggest that Brad Pitt is secretly involved with architect Neri Oxman, leaving Jen to consider the possibility of single parenthood. Since their separation, Jen and Justin have maintained distance, and sources indicate that they had an intense argument when Justin returned to their Bel Air home to collect his remaining belongings. Now, with the public release of images depicting Justin's intimate date with Emma, it is expected that the relationship between Justin and Jen will become even more strained.

Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated [\u2026] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  \u2018I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'

Jill, the former Real Housewife of New York, was seen wearing an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, mingling with fans, taking photos, and catching up with old friends. Trying to get an interview with her turned into a scavenger hunt as she was constantly on the move. Throughout the event, there were various vendors selling products, including wine and sex toys. Guests also had the opportunity to receive a vitamin infusion while sitting under the sun, creating a sauna-like experience. Housewives from different parts of the country, such as Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas, flew in to attend the luncheon, which also served as a fundraiser for Thyroid Cancer Research in memory of Jill's late husband, Bobby. When initially approached for an interview, Jill sent her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her place. Ally shared her thoughts on last year's luncheon when her stepfather was battling cancer. She mentioned that despite the difficult circumstances, he encouraged them to enjoy the event. Ally, who now lives in London, admitted that she finds it challenging to watch old episodes of Real Housewives due to the portrayal of her struggling to connect with her stepfather. She shared how strangers in the UK recognize her from the show. Ally also mentioned that her mother has been casually dating a man she plays tennis with, which has been a positive distraction for her since she lives in London. Dina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set, arrived fashionably late and was immediately surrounded by people wanting to chat or take pictures with her. Eventually, she settled down and spoke about her daughter Lindsay's upcoming reality show for MTV, which is inspired by Vanderpump Rules and follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Dina mentioned that the show is being produced by the same company that worked on Lindsay's E! reality show from a decade ago. She also revealed that Lindsay's younger sister, Ali, has contributed to the show by providing the theme song. During the conversation, a friend of Dina asked if Ali, like Lindsay, had moved to L.A. for work, to which Dina firmly responded that Ali is in New York with her and she intends to keep her daughters close. Finally, Jill Zarin took a moment to pause and breathe. Although she is no longer a part of Bravo's Real Housewives, she still possesses the skills of schmoozing like a housewife. Jill mentioned that she has been keeping up with the latest season of the show and received a message of support from Luann de Lesseps, who recently entered rehab.

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said \"Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?\"    'And I said\u2026 \"OK\" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said.

Being two of the biggest young stars of their time, their relationship has garnered a wide range of admirers, from supportive to completely obsessed. Tracking their on-again, off-again relationship has been quite challenging, but luckily, we've broken down every single breakup and makeup they've had. Get comfortable, because there's a lot to cover. In January 2011, their dating rumors were finally confirmed when they were spotted showing major PDA while on vacation in St. Lucia. They made their red carpet debut as a couple in February 2011 at the Vanity Fair Oscars party. The young lovebirds looked happy and in love at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2011. In November 2011, rumors of their breakup circulate after a Bieber fan claims that she had sex with him backstage at a show and that he is the father of her child. However, these rumors are proven false. The couple officially breaks up in November 2012, supposedly due to their busy schedules. Bieber is briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin during this time.

Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 24 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.) Last summer, he was accused of creating an abusive \u201csex cult\u201d of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly\u2019s hands. (Through a lawyer, Kelly denied all accusations, saying he would \u201cwork diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.\u201d) And in April, another woman accused Kelly of \u201cknowingly and intentionally infecting her with an STD.\u201d Her lawyers say they are currently preparing a federal civil lawsuit. Through a spokesperson, Kelly issued a statement to the Washington Post in which he \u201ccategorically denies all claims and allegations.\u201d As man after man has fallen to the #MeToo reckoning, losing jobs and retiring from public life after being accused of sexual harassment and assault, there\u2019s been a recurring whisper: What about R. Kelly? Despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly\u2019s career has marched steadily on. Last year, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. This year, he\u2019s touring with singer Charlie Wilson (some protests are planned). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3. At this year\u2019s Coachella, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a \u201cchild molester\u201d in an interview with Complex, insisting, \u201cHe pees on people.\u201d In our post-#MeToo, post-Time\u2019s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he continues to work as much as he does. But Staples\u2019s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, \u201cWe can\u2019t ever talk about this guy. ... You\u2019re about to get me fired from Coachella. It\u2019s my first time here.\u201d Later, Staples tweeted that \u201cR.

Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a recent BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes. And over the past year, at least five members of Kelly\u2019s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in December: \u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a shitbag.\u201d In April, the Women of Color committee within Time\u2019s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly\u2019s record label, RCA. Shortly thereafter, Spotify announced that it would no longer be promoting Kelly\u2019s music, although his music would remain in their streaming catalog. It\u2019s possible that these new developlments mean things are changing for Kelly, and that he\u2019s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that\u2019s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him. There is a persistent vagueness to the way we talk about R.

Trivial observations, such as a photo of Aniston placing her hand on her stomach, have been enough for certain tabloids to speculate about her becoming a mother. In the latest issue of Star magazine, the headline reads, \"Jen To Justin: I'll Raise Our Baby Alone!\" The article claims that Aniston, desiring motherhood, has hired a surrogate and is prepared to embark on this journey with or without her husband. Allegedly, Aniston confided in an anonymous source, disclosing her troubled marriage and her commitment to raise the child as a single parent.\nHowever, this account quickly loses credibility when contradictory statements are mentioned. The insider claims that Aniston is actively searching for the right surrogate, which contradicts their previous assertion. This discrepancy raises doubts regarding the authenticity of the claim.\nMany individuals view this tabloid story as entirely false, as the contradictory statements within the article suggest a lack of truthfulness.

This comes as a surprise, considering her previous 1989 world tour was immensely successful, becoming the highest grossing tour of 2015. However, it seems that her current persona as a more expensive and edgy artist is proving to be a tougher sell.\nJust last month, a tour promoter, who has worked with Swift for a long time, confidently stated to Billboard that all tickets would be sold out by Taylor's birthday, with concerts around the world sold out as well. However, Taylor's birthday has passed and not a single date on her tour has sold out.\nDespite this, it is important to note that Reputation was the top-selling album of 2017, indicating that the tour is expected to have a decent turnout. Therefore, while the Post's headline claiming that the tour is shaping up to be a disaster may be an exaggeration, it does bring attention to certain issues such as unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and the role of Ticketmaster in general.\nTicketmaster's \"Verified Fan\" program, which is supposed to reward music lovers, appears to be more focused on profit rather than providing a fair opportunity to fans. The program allegedly takes advantage of teens who are obsessed with Swift and have easy access to their parents' credit card numbers. By spending money on merchandise, fans can supposedly improve their chances of getting better positions in the ticket queue. However, once the tickets are accessible, they often turn out to be too expensive for many fans to afford.\nA fan mentioned in the Post article shared that they had paid $150 for their ticket with excellent seats during the 1989 tour. Now, for similar seating, they are expected to pay around $500. This significant increase in ticket prices is certainly a cause for concern.\nOn a related note, it is worth mentioning that tickets for Katy Perry's upcoming show in New Orleans are currently available starting at $23.", 1], ["Emma Watson was honored with the prestigious Woman of the Year trophy at the ELLE Style Awards on Monday night.

(Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Ivanka Trump\u2019s products weren\u2019t always the hottest items online. In January, for instance, the first daughter\u2019s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes. That changed dramatically the following month. Sales of Trump\u2019s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst\u2019s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before. Yes, Feb. 9 \u2014 the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump\u2019s clothing and jewelry line on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff is what I would tell you,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.\u201d And viewers did, apparently. Sales of Ivanka Trump\u2019s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst) Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that \u201cthe beginning of February\u201d shows \u201cthe best performing weeks in the history of the brand.\u201d \u201cFor several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,\u201d Klem said. Sarah Tanner, Lyst\u2019s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter\u2019s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company. Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly] But the brand was \u201clargely featured\u201d in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales. \u201cIt would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,\u201d Tanner said of Conway\u2019s Fox interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.\u201d Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?] Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line,\u201d The Washington Post reported. The White House later said that Conway had been \u201ccounseled.\u201d But concerns about her comments remain. On Thursday, the government\u2019s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post\u2019s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president\u2019s deputy counsel. \u201cWhen an employee\u2019s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,\u201d Shaub wrote. \u201cNot taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.\u201d [A Trump voter\u2019s message to retailers: \u2018Keep your mouths shut about our president\u2019] Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway \u2014 a", 1], ["The book of Jelena took a new turn in the autumn of 2017 when news emerged that the two were spending time together again.

It is important to acknowledge that many citizens, disenchanted with the path President-elect Trump has charted, have made the conscious decision to abstain from witnessing the inauguration ceremony.\nThe decision by some Americans to forego witnessing this momentous occasion, which has typically served as a symbol of unity and hope for the future, reflects the deep-seated concerns felt by a significant portion of the population. These concerns largely stem from the controversies and various policy stances that have characterized Trump's unconventional campaign and transition.\nIt is worth noting that this resistance is not solely confined to the general public.

Many express their refusal as an act of solidarity with constituents who feel marginalized by Trump's rhetoric, policies, or actions. It is evident that controversy continues to follow the president-elect, even as he prepares to take the oath of office.\nNevertheless, the momentous nature of the inauguration cannot be overlooked.

The world watches with bated breath as the United States, a global superpower, transitions power to the 45th president.\nWhether Americans choose to watch or abstain from the inauguration, it is the hope of many that unity, mutual respect, and progress will prevail during Trump's tenure.

Trump steps onto the grand stage on January 20th to usher in a new era, it is clear that not everyone will be watching.

She has received an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards, and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, Jon Voight, in Lookin' to Get Out (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production Cyborg 2 (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, Hackers (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical cable films George Wallace (1997) and Gia (1998), and won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the drama Girl, Interrupted (1999). Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine Lara Croft in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), and Salt (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas A Mighty Heart (2007) and Changeling (2008), which earned her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015), and First They Killed My Father (2017). In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she separated from her third husband, actor Brad Pitt, in September 2016. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. Early life and family Born in Los Angeles, California, Jolie is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[2] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[3] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[4] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[5][6] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[5] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[7] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[5][8] After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[9] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[10] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[11] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[12] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[13] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[9] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.

Previously embraced as the ultimate bachelor, adorned twice on the cover of People's Sexiest Man Alive, Clooney now embarks on a transformative journey. Delighting their supporters on Tuesday, the couple proudly shared their status as new parents, joyfully welcoming their twins, Ella and Alexander. Throughout his versatile career as an actor, director, producer, and activist, Clooney had seemingly distanced himself from the concept of fatherhood. Could it have been his graying hair, the fleeting presence of models on his arm, or the persistent suggestions of settling down from tabloids and co-stars? Conceivably. Alternatively, it could be attributed to Clooney's consistent declarations, repeated numerous times in countless interviews over many years, stating his disinterest in having children. Consequently, the 56-year-old first-time father contended with frequent questioning about his future as a bachelor. However, everything changed in April 2014 when he proposed to Amal, culminating in a September wedding. The couple even shared their wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain, thereby offering a glimpse into their newfound happiness. As Clooney himself once declared, \"I don\u2019t see myself ever having kids.\" Yet, the path to parenthood was undeniably extensive. \"I don\u2019t have that gene that people have to replicate,\" Clooney shared candidly with People in 2006. When Esquire inquired about his unmarried and childless status, Clooney responded with a lack of aspiration. He mused, \"I haven\u2019t had aspirations in that way, ever.\" Regarding skepticism surrounding his lifestyle as a single man without children in his 50s, Clooney facetiously questioned whether he should abruptly change course and seek fatherhood in haste. Reflecting on his ability to connect with his onscreen portrayals of fathers, Clooney challenged the notion. He likened the situation to his roles as a president in \"Ides of March,\" a lawyer in \"Michael Clayton,\" or a professional \"firer\" in \"Up in the Air,\" stating that his acting prowess extended beyond personal experience. Clooney jokingly expressed his exasperation, affirming his stance on marriage and children just three months before proposing to Amal in an interview with Britain's Daily Express. Dismissing any surprise, Clooney joins a lineage of celebrities who chose to embrace fatherhood later in life. Entertainer Steve Martin welcomed his child at the age of 67 in 2012, Elton John became a father at 63 through surrogacy in 2010, and Chris Noth embraced fatherhood at 53 in 2008. While Clooney's persona has always been marked by delightful and devilish charm, his decision to become a parent showcases the evolving nature of our ever-changing popular culture. In the statement announcing the birth of his twins, Clooney's humor remained intact as he assured everyone of their health and happiness. He joked that he would require some time to recover while providing his assurance that he was sedated and would soon be back on his feet.", 1], ["On Tuesday, ABC made the decision to cancel the show 'Roseanne' following a tweet by the actress Roseanne Barr, in which she compared Valerie Jarrett, a former advisor to President Barack Obama, to an ape.

The overwhelming sentiment expressed was one of appreciation towards ABC for taking action against racism and bigotry, with many commending the network for making the right decision. \nThe range of opinions expressed on Twitter included Ava DuVernay, who posted an image of herself sitting confidently alongside a statement chastising Barr. Tom Arnold raised questions about his own status with ABC after previously calling out Barr for her racist conspiracy tweets.

Mark Hamill speculated about the possibility of another network picking up the show, while Tour\u00e9 and Shonda Rhimes both expressed satisfaction that Barr faced consequences for her actions. Charlie Sheen bid farewell to 'Roseanne,' suggesting that the cancellation cleared the way for a different reboot.\nIn summary, ABC's decision to cancel 'Roseanne' after Roseanne Barr's offensive tweet prompted widespread support and commendation, with many individuals emphasizing the importance of not tolerating racism and bigotry in society.", 1], ["Taylor Swift Takes New York City By Storm with Exclusive '1989' Secret Session\nNew York City - In a mesmerizing display of raw talent and unmatched stage presence, international superstar Taylor Swift enchanted a select group of lucky fans during her highly anticipated '1989' Secret Session on Monday, October 27th, in the heart of the Big Apple.

Recently, a preposterous report emerged, accusing the talented artist Ed Sheeran of a heinous betrayal toward his long-time friend, Taylor Swift, supposedly involving another notable singer, Katy Perry. However, after thorough investigation, Gossip Cop can confidently reveal the truth behind these unfounded claims.\nThe absurd notion that Ed Sheeran, an acclaimed musician and beacon of integrity, could have violated the sacred bonds of friendship with Taylor Swift is not only baseless but also a blight on the realm of responsible journalism. We, as responsible members of the press, have the duty to disseminate accurate information, devoid of sensationalism and falsehoods. Therefore, as concerned individuals committed to the truth, we undertook an exhaustive investigation into these claims to set the record straight.\nOur inquiries, met with diligence and attention to detail, have concluded that there is absolutely no shred of evidence to support the outlandish allegations made against Mr. Sheeran. What emerged from our investigation is a tangled web of misconstrued events that spun out of control into a frenzy of untruths. In fact, far from any purported discord, Sheeran and Swift's friendship continues to flourish, cemented by mutual respect, admiration, and unwavering loyalty.\nIt is disappointing that irresponsible reporting can sow seeds of doubt and create unnecessary friction between esteemed artists who have long-standing friendships. Such provocations only serve to divide and harm, rather than propagate the spirit of camaraderie that should prevail within the creative industry.\nIt is crucial, now more than ever, that we approach news stories with discretion and truthfulness, ensuring that we maintain the integrity of our craft.

More Reviews Venice Film review: 'Isis, Tomorrow. The Lost Souls of Mosul' Telluride Film Review: 'They'll Love Me When I'm Dead' The 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn\u2019t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy. But from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like \u201cVictim of Love\u201d-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That\u2019s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll movie since \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows. Jackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look \u2014 the beard and rancher\u2019s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle \u2014 mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock \u2018n\u2019 roll strutted its \u201cauthenticity,\u201d but now that he\u2019s out of date, Jackson\u2019s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber.

If I was doing something, I'd be at rehearsals right now. So, obviously, there's your proof.\" Fatone seemed unperturbed by the absence of a reunion, commenting, \"There's nothing wrong with that.

His new album, ye, doesn\u2019t merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn\u2019t sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month\u2019s behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist\u2019s personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track \u2018I Thought About Killing You\u2019, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on \u2018No Mistakes\u2019, to keep his fans just interested enough. It\u2019s telling that the one standout track, \u2018Ghost Town\u2019 is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn\u2019t even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he\u2019s become blas\u00e9 and doesn\u2019t want to spend time on music anymore.

While we may have seen Johnson in some pretty intimate positions on-screen, there\u2019s definitely a lot we don\u2019t know about the Fifty Shades star. Like, for instance, the superfluity of familiar names in her family tree. Seeing that her popular movie, Fifty Shades Darker came out on the day of love\u2014Valentine's Day\u2014it's only fitting to dedicate a piece to the actress who brought us the sexy and quaint, Anastasia Steele. Johnson, after all, has become somewhat something of a Valentine\u2019s Day staple, herself. Here are 15 facts about Dakota Johnson or, as some might call her, \"that girl from Fifty Shades of Grey.\" We guarantee that she will no longer by \"that girl\" by the end of the list! 15 Her Family Tree Is Full Of Famous Faces You know how we said there are a few familiar names in her family tree? Well, we weren\u2019t lying. Her parents are fellow actors, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Unfortunately, her parents divorced in 1994 so Dakota had to split her time between the two. \"It was the only way that I could be with them,\" she said in an interview for Cosmopolitan. \"And since they were divorced, I would spend two weeks with one and two weeks with the other, traveling with a tutor.\" But wait, it gets better. Her maternal grandmother (can you guess..) is Hitchcock actress Tippi Hedren. Yes, that\u2019s right, so clearly creative talent lies in that family. We\u2019ve never heard of a family tree with so many famous names! Thanksgiving is probably a whirlwind. Now, Dakota Johnson is another famous name in that tree. 14 She\u2019s An Animal Rights Activist advertising Just like her grandmother Tippi Hedren, Dakota Johnson is also an animal rights activist. Like grandmother, like granddaughter shall we say? As animal lovers ourselves, we\u2019re pleased to hear that she\u2019s following in her grandmother\u2019s footsteps\u2014both in acting and in animal rights. In 2014, Johnson saved 12 horses from being slaughtered by paying for them. What a sweet thing to do! We bet her grandmother was really proud. It\u2019s always so great to hear about celebrities doing positive things - so naturally, we\u2019re happy to hear of Dakota\u2019s compassionate side. We admit we have a soft spot for animal lovers, but who doesn't? We always love hearing about people doing good deeds for animals and it\u2019s always nice to hear celebrities using their celebrity title for the better. 13 She Grew Up Shooting Guns And Riding Horses In Colorado She may play the innocent and naive Anastasia Steele in the Fifty Shades movies, but growing up Johnson was anything but naive. She grew up in Colorado at her dad\u2019s house, where she learned to build a fire, ride a horse, ride motorbikes, and even shoot a gun. And this was all before she was just 10 years old! Sounds like a badass kid to us! But when she wasn\u2019t at her father\u2019s house, she was at her mom\u2019s house in L.A. which she also loved. It's hard to imagine a 10 year old these days shooting guns, riding motorbikes, or building fires without being grounded. But it sounds like she had a pretty inspiring and freeing childhood which makes us fall for the actress all the more. 12 She Never Dates advertising By the header, we mean she never has casual relationships. She only has long-term relationships. Good for her, is all we can say! You hear of so many celebrities who are constantly dating other celebrities. You can barely keep up with who they\u2019re dating these days. It seems to be one guy or girl after another. So it\u2019s great to hear of Dakota\u2019s conservative views on relationships. Apparently she\u2019s only ever been in long-term, serious relationships; she doesn\u2019t just date. That probably explains why she\u2019s been in a relationship with model Matthew Hitt since 2014. Yes, it\u2019s been a kind of an on-and-off relationship but they\u2019ve been in it for the long haul so far. So, to sum up, we like her whole dating attitude.

Her portrayal of a drug addict in the film \"The Town\" exhibits a perplexing amalgamation of Boston accents akin to the mismatched dynamic in \"Bride Wars.\" Similarly, her performance in \"The Age of Adaline,\" where she plays a perpetually young woman cursed with eternal youth, is reminiscent of observing a mermaid effortlessly maneuvering a bicycle. Though she endeavors to excel, her acting prowess has yet to catch up to her algorithmically generated beauty. Unfortunately, it seems that there may not be an algorithmic remedy for this disparity. Consequently, I approached the notion of witnessing her tremble on a buoy, tending to her own injuries, conversing with animals, or assuming the persona of a Nancy with less enthusiasm. Nonetheless, witnessing her poised presence on a surfboard offers a refreshing perspective. While certain actors thrive in the context of motion pictures, there are others whose essence may be more aligned with a product like beer, beans, or even air. I am aware of the skeptics who question Kate Hudson's abilities, yet I believe that personal preferences transcend such concerns. In fact, I would willingly purchase any product endorsed by Ms. Hudson. The industrial disparity between the capabilities of actresses like Kate Hudson and Blake Lively may not be significant. Although I do not view them as interchangeable, there are instances when the film industry contradicts this notion and corrects itself through market forces. One mustn't become too infatuated with Mark Harmon, as Kevin Costner is bound to emerge as the next phenomenon. Similarly, it is wise to divest from Brad Rowe stocks as Brad Pitt emerges as the inevitable replacement. (This shift was quite evident during the late 1990s.) Nonetheless, there are gradients within this continuum. Channing Tatum, for example, represents a versatile, hip-hop-infused upgrade of Brendan Fraser's persona from a bygone era. Many roles typically assigned to Ms. Lively could have been effortlessly portrayed by Ms. Hudson. Yet, circumstances intervened, prompting another actress to take center stage. (It is always someone else's turn.) What frustrates me about the dearth of Kate Hudson's presence and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is akin to the annoyance felt when an otherwise functional software undergoes an unnecessary update, or when an overzealous waiter abruptly removes an unfinished plate at a restaurant: I had not concluded my experience.", 1], ["The individual who captured footage of Justin Bieber asleep has recently shared her account of the night she spent with the renowned Canadian artist.

Prior to her interview on Brazilian TV, Neves reportedly confided in friends, mentioning Bieber's marijuana use and their time spent together. During her appearance on Globo TV's Fantastico, she was questioned about the arrival of numerous girls at 3am, suspected to have been transported from a nearby club. Neves confidently responded, \"No. By that point, I had already gone to the bedroom with him.\" Neves also revealed that she filmed Bieber while he was asleep, his cherished baseball cap nearby, the next morning after awakening first. She explained, \"I woke up and he was still sleeping, so I starting chatting with a girlfriend.\" Some sources suggest that Neves met Bieber at the Centaurus club in Rio, a notorious establishment known for its connection to the sex trade. However, Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, contradicts Neves' claims. Mion confirms that Neves was not among the 30 girls personally selected by Bieber to accompany him back to his rented villa.

Hailing from Spain, she is introduced in the chapter titled \"The New Marguerite\", where it is disclosed that she had been unable to partake in the ceremony for the former managers. As the narrative unfolds, she finds herself confronted by Erik, who warns her of dire consequences should she dare perform at the Opera House. Undeterred, she dismisses the threat, only to face a humiliating ordeal during her performance. To her dismay, raucous sounds escape her vocal cords while the chandelier crashes down upon the stage. Consumed by shame, she withdraws from the public eye for several weeks before finally reclaiming her place at the opera house.\nIn the original 1925 silent film adaptation of Leroux's masterpiece, Carlotta is portrayed by Virginia Pearson, sharing the screen with the legendary Lon Chaney. Subsequently, in 1929, sound scenes were incorporated, leading to the recasting of Mary Fabian as Carlotta due to her singing abilities. However, Virginia Pearson remained, now assuming the role of Carlotta's mother. These alterations persisted in the 1929 silent, foreign version of the film, which is the most widely viewed rendition.\nFast forward to the 1943 film adaptation, where Carlotta takes on a new identity as Mme. Biancarolli. Entrapped and drugged by the Phantom, Mme. Biancarolli meets a harrowing end, along with her loyal maid, when she imprudently attempts to unveil the Phantom's concealed countenance.\nIn Andrew Lloyd Webber's illustrious stage production, Carlotta, now bearing the surname Giudicelli, hails from Italy and commands a prominent singing role. As the prima donna of the opera company, she harbors a vehement animosity towards Christine Daa\u00e9, perceiving her as a formidable rivalry jeopardizing her position. Moreover, Carlotta becomes entangled in the Phantom's deceptive machinations, eventually succumbing to her tears upon the heart-wrenching discovery of her lover, tenor Ubaldo Piangi, murdered on stage. An intriguing revelation from the film adaptation exposes her affinity for poodles.\nIn the 2004 film version helmed by Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, the role of Carlotta is brought to life by Minnie Driver. Due to Driver's limited experience in opera, her singing voice is skillfully dubbed by opera singer Margaret Preece, while Driver herself lends her authentic voice to the captivating song \"Learn to Be Lonely\" featured in the end credits.\nLastly, Nicholas Meyer's novel The Canary Trainer presents a unique amalgamation of characters, merging Carlotta and La Sorelli into one, despite their individual mentions in the original novel. Even more intriguingly, Kim Newman's short story \"Angels of Music\" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series hints at Carlotta being the ancestral connection to Bianca Castafiore of The Adventures of Tintin comic series.", 1], ["Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn\u2019t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.

Most of Middleton\u2019s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around \u00a330 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least \u00a3250,000, or $350,000.

Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.

Director J.J. Abrams assured fans that the movie will utilize previously unseen footage of Fisher from Episode VII, debunking any concerns about CGI resurrections or recasting. However, given the limited amount of unused footage available, it is likely that Leia's role in the movie will be relatively small. The context of the footage suggests that Leia will continue to embody her role as a determined leader, despite the losses she has suffered in the previous films. There is speculation that the Fisher footage may be used in flashbacks or during funeral scenes, which would alleviate some of the challenges in incorporating her into the plot. Abrams' statement also raises questions about the extent of postproduction alterations that may be applied to the Fisher footage. While he emphasized the avoidance of computer-generated characters, it remains to be seen if certain modifications, such as digital trickery or posthumous dubbing, will be utilized. Nonetheless, any edits or alterations must be executed with subtlety and sensitivity to maintain the appropriate tone and respect for Fisher's legacy. The decision to source the footage from The Force Awakens is fitting, as it aligns with the project's pre-existing expectations and the careful handling of fan reactions.

However, today, serious concerns arise as the price of a single coronavirus test reaches an astonishing $3,200.\nAs economies struggle to navigate the turmoil caused by the pandemic, questions surrounding accessibility and affordability of essential medical services have come to the forefront, with COVID-19 testing being no exception. The exorbitant costs associated with testing have triggered widespread alarm, as both individuals and governments grapple with the extraordinary financial burden.\nThe significant price tag\u2014$3,200 per coronavirus test\u2014has raised eyebrows and rent the fabric of socio-economic equality. A test that was supposed to serve as a crucial stepping stone to accessing timely healthcare has inadvertently transformed into a luxury only available to the privileged few. This astronomical expense threatens to exacerbate the existing inequalities, leaving disadvantaged communities grappling with the virus without adequate means to detect and mitigate its spread.\nHealthcare experts and economists around the world now call for an urgent reevaluation of the pricing structure for COVID-19 tests. Such a high fee sends a disconcerting message, tarnishing the goal of ensuring widespread virus detection and containment. Critics argue that the exorbitant cost not only jeopardizes global health but also undermines the collective effort to curb the spread of the virus.\nWith the virus showing no signs of relenting, widespread and affordable testing is pivotal to slow down the transmission and protect communities from further viral surges. Governments, as responsible stewards of public welfare, must urgently orchestrate collaborative efforts with pharmaceutical companies and medical institutions to significantly reduce the cost of COVID-19 tests, making them accessible to all individuals regardless of their financial status.\nInvesting in accessible COVID-19 testing should be viewed not only as a humanitarian imperative but also as a wise economic decision in the long run. By enabling affordable testing, governments can promptly identify and isolate cases, contributing to the containment efforts and facilitating the safe reopening of businesses, schools, and overall economic recovery.\nIn conclusion, the astronomical price of $3,200 for a single coronavirus test is a distressing development that threatens to undermine global public health efforts to combat the virus. As countries strive to rebuild, it is imperative that authorities urgently address this issue by collaborating with healthcare providers to ensure widespread, accessible, and affordable testing for all.

Firmly rooted in objectivity, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation.\nAs the country navigated the unparalleled challenges posed by the pandemic, the Kennedy Center, like numerous cultural institutions, found itself grappling with unprecedented financial strains. Recognizing the significance of the cultural sector, Congress took crucial steps to fortify these organizations and help them weather the economic storm through the CARES Act.\nUnder the CARES Act, the Kennedy Center received financial support amounting to an undisclosed sum. This aid was intended to preserve jobs, provide crucial financial stability, and ensure the continuity of its programs. However, recently surfaced claims suggest that a substantial portion of these funds was subsequently donated to the DNC.\nTo accurately assess the situation, it is essential to approach these claims with due diligence. Verified information regarding the allocation of funds and donations is pertinent to arrive at an evidence-based conclusion. Any allegations of misappropriation or impropriety must be thoroughly investigated and substantiated.\nTransparency should be maintained to comprehend the dynamics between organizations engaged in such financial transactions. In this particular case, clarity surrounding the timing, context, and motivation behind the purported donation is vital to fully discern its legitimacy.\nMoreover, it is equally important to underscore that organizations, including the Kennedy Center, have the right to support political causes within the parameters of the law.

Consequently, regulations have been implemented with the intention of reducing large gatherings, where social distancing measures may not be logistically feasible.\nWhile churches and mosques both hold an integral place of worship within their respective communities, each establishment must be assessed based on the unique risks and challenges it presents during these unprecedented times. Mosques, characterized by their spacious architecture, typically offer larger areas that facilitate congregation without compromising social distancing measures. Additionally, many mosques have proactively implemented sanitization and hygiene practices to ensure the safety of their attendees.\nIn sharp contrast, numerous churches, owing to architectural constraints and varying congregation sizes, have faced obstacles in reconciling the need for public worship with the imperatives of effective contagion management.

The global health body has stated that the virus has infected millions worldwide and claimed a substantial number of lives, wreaking havoc on economies and straining healthcare systems.\nGiven Limbaugh's immense influence in the media, his perceived downplaying of COVID-19's impact has drawn significant concern from both experts and ordinary citizens. Public health officials who have tirelessly worked to curtail the pandemic fear that the influential radio host's remarks could undermine public trust and adherence to vital preventive measures.\nAs the world struggles to address the complexities of this ongoing health crisis, it is essential to rely on scientifically verified information and guidance from reputable health authorities. The World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other leading organizations have repeatedly emphasized the highly contagious nature and significant potential for severe illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\nIn response to Limbaugh's remarks, prominent health professionals swiftly took to social media and public platforms to express their disagreement and concerns. They stressed that COVID-19 is a novel pathogen that affects the respiratory system and exhibits distinct characteristics from the common cold. Furthermore, they highlighted the virus's ability to cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a wide array of complications, the extent of which remains under vigorous investigation.\nThe scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the urgent need for stringent measures to protect public health, including robust testing, contact tracing, social distancing, and mask-wearing. Scientists and researchers worldwide continue to dedicate their efforts to understanding the novel coronavirus and developing effective treatments and vaccines to combat the global crisis.\nIn times of such uncertainty, it is imperative that individuals remain vigilant, informed, and follow the guidance provided by reputable health organizations. Dismissing the severity of the novel coronavirus can result in dire consequences for public health and impede concerted global efforts to limit the virus's spread.\nAs the world races against time to regain control over this devastating pandemic, it is crucial that public discourse concerning COVID-19 maintains a responsible and data-driven focus. The impact of influential figures endorsing misconceptions can lead to undesired consequences and hinder the collective global effort to overcome this unprecedented challenge.\nNote: The preceding news article was created on an AI language model to showcase how a journalist might cover the story.

The potential enactment of martial law, a highly controversial measure, raises questions about the nation's current state of affairs and the need for extraordinary action to restore order and safeguard public safety.\nRising tensions, political unrest, and a series of unforeseen challenges have brought the nation to this critical juncture. As public officials and citizens brace themselves for the uncertain road ahead, the potential implementation of martial law has sparked intense debates about its necessity, scope, and potential impacts on civil liberties.\nWhile the United States has traditionally prided itself on strong democratic values and the rule of law, some argue that extraordinary circumstances demand equally extraordinary responses. Martial law is viewed by its proponents as a tool that can effectively address the urgent need for stability, ensuring public safety during times of profound crisis.\nThough the phrase \"martial law\" can be unsettling, it is essential to understand its true meaning. In the most basic terms, martial law empowers the military to take temporary control of essential civilian functions. This measure serves to protect the nation and its citizens when standard law enforcement mechanisms become overwhelmed or compromised due to extraordinary circumstances such as civil unrest, catastrophic natural disasters, or widespread domestic threats.\nWith this possibility looming, experts have sought to provide context and clarity regarding the potential triggers for implementing martial law. Consulting constitutional scholars, historians, and legal authorities have emphasized that such a measure should only be enacted when there is a clear and present danger to the safety and security of the nation, its institutions, and its people.\nIt is important to note, however, that the prospect of martial law has alarmed civil rights activists and those concerned about potential abuses of power. Critics argue that this action poses a genuine risk to personal freedoms, potentially enabling unchecked military authority, and eroding the very democratic principles upon which this great nation was built.\nIn the event of martial law, strict curfews, increased military presence, and temporary suspension of certain fundamental rights would be expected. These measures, while drastic, are thought to be indispensable for restoring order and security during times of severe instability.\nPublic reaction to the possibility of martial law has been swift and varied. Some individuals are supportive, believing it to be essential for maintaining stability, while others express deep concerns over the potential infringement on civil liberties and human rights.\nAs the nation waits anxiously for further developments, it is clear that a multitude of factors will influence the decision-making process. The government must assess the gravity of the situation, weighing it against the potential consequences of implementing martial law. The voice of the people, as expressed through their elected representatives and community leaders, remains crucial in shaping any decision of this magnitude.\nThe United States finds itself at a critical crossroads, faced with the daunting task of reconciling the necessity for order and security with the preservation of civil liberties.

Pioneering research has now set the stage for a potential breakthrough, paving the way for a deeper understanding of our immune system's resilience in battling the ongoing pandemic.\nRecent investigations conducted by esteemed medical professionals have highlighted the intriguing role played by T cells in combating the novel coronavirus. These small yet mighty guardians of our immune system have emerged as an integral force in our fight against the invisible enemy that has gripped the world for more than a year.\nThe prevailing theory, supported by an array of scientific evidence, suggests that individuals harboring preexisting T-cell immunity are far more likely to exhibit milder symptoms when exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It appears that, in some cases, these T cells act as vigilant sentinels, primed and ready to recognize and neutralize the virus at its earliest encounter, thus mitigating the severity of the illness and reducing mortality rates.\nAs a testament to the significance of these findings, renowned health expert Dr. Berg has released an enlightening report, titled \"COVID Waves: Understanding the Impressive Impact of T-Cell Immunity.\" This comprehensive study, downloadable for immediate access at http://drberg.com/covid-waves, delves deep into the nuances of T-cell-mediated immunity and its potential implications for public health strategies worldwide. Dr. Berg's report harnesses multiple credible sources and scientific studies to elucidate the intricate relationship between T-cell immunity and curbing COVID-19 transmission.\nDrawing expertise from distinguished researchers and thought leaders in the field, Dr. Berg's report establishes a compelling argument that preexisting T-cell immunity could be a driving force behind the decline in COVID-19 cases and mortality rates witnessed during recent waves of the pandemic. By analyzing and aggregating multiple references, Dr. Berg unveils meticulously researched evidence that supports the theory of T-cell-induced suppression of severe COVID-19 symptoms.\nThese groundbreaking research findings underline the paramount importance of understanding our immune system's formidable defenses against SARS-CoV-2. Exploring the depths of preexisting T-cell immunity is indeed a significant leap toward unravelling the secrets behind our collective ability to withstand the relentless waves of COVID-19.\nWhile this new insight demonstrates remarkable promise, it warrants further investigation and independent verification. Experts worldwide are grappling with the urgency to validate these findings in larger, broader studies to ascertain the precise role T-cell immunity plays in mitigating severe COVID-19 symptoms and preventing mortality.\nAs humanity confronts the ever-evolving challenges posed by this global health crisis, the revelation of T-cell immunity's potential impact offers a glimmer of hope. This important breakthrough fosters not only scientific advancements but also provides a renewed sense of optimism, driving us closer to the day when the veil of uncertainty that shrouds our daily lives will be lifted.\nReferences:\n1.

This revelation has left experts and citizens alike pondering the nature of our world and the information that surrounds us.\nThe CARES Act, which stands for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, was signed into law on March 27, 2020. It was a comprehensive legislative package aimed at mitigating the economic fallout caused by the unprecedented health crisis. However, suspicions have surfaced that the groundwork for this historic act may have been laid months beforehand.\nWhile exploring the timeline of events leading up to the pandemic, astute observers have noticed that the bill's name, 'CARES Act', shares the same acronym as the virus itself\u2014COVID-19. Although this similarity seems coincidental, it has fueled speculation regarding the true intentions behind introducing such legislation at an apparently unassuming time.\nCritics argue that the mere existence of the CARES Act in early 2019 sends an inconspicuous signal of meticulous planning surrounding the pandemic. Their main contention is that if the virus did not exist until late 2019, how could a significant legislative response be devised so quickly unless aspects of the pandemic were premeditated?\nSupporters of this theory contend that governments and influential bodies often orchestrate events to foreshadow future events, wielding an uncanny influence over public perception and policy-making. They insist that the introduction of the CARES Act ahead of time aligns suspiciously with this line of reasoning, portraying a premeditated endeavor to manage the anticipated fallout.\nHowever, it is essential to approach these claims with caution, as rigorous empirical evidence is required before attributing such intent to the CARES Act. Suggesting that the bill's timely introduction proves advanced knowledge of the pandemic is speculative and lacks empirical basis.\nFurthermore, while coincidences like the shared acronym between the bill and the virus may captivate the imagination, they rarely hold true under scrutiny. Scrutinizing the origin and intentions of the bill is essential, but it is crucial not to let our judgments become clouded by baseless conspiracies.\nThe intricacies of governance and policy-making are complex, with numerous factors contributing to the timing and naming of bills. Just as the CARES Act aimed to provide necessary relief during an unprecedented crisis, we must focus on concrete actions and evidence-based insights to overcome this global catastrophe.\nIn the face of uncertainty and the torrent of information surrounding COVID-19, it is crucial to retain a level-headed approach.

Only through international solidarity and evidence-based policies can we surmount the challenges that lay ahead.\nIn the meantime, continue to maintain social distancing, follow guidelines provided by reputable health organizations, and remain vigilant against misinformation that could hinder our progress in combating this global crisis.\nStay informed, stay safe, and remember, we must work together as a global community to overcome this pandemic, regardless of the origins of the CARES Act.\n*Note: AI-generated news is purely fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.*", 1], ["Russian President Putin released 500 lions onto the streets to keep people indoors.

Critics argue that the significant involvement of a laboratory in the creation of this potent virus raises numerous questions and reinforces theories concerning its deliberate release, suggesting a malevolent intent behind its existence. Others, however, have cautioned against rushing to conclusions, stressing the importance of comprehensive investigations and balanced scientific inquiry.\nAlthough it has long been understood that emerging viruses can pose serious threats to global health, the discovery that this particular virus may not have naturally evolved but instead was engineered in a controlled environment is sending shockwaves rippling through scientific circles. The implications reach far beyond the ongoing pandemic, illustrating potential misuse or unintended consequences of scientific experimentation.\nScientists and experts worldwide have engaged in rigorous discussions surrounding the origins of the virus, emphasizing the necessity for transparency in scientific research and demanding a thorough investigation to ascertain the authenticity of these claims. The alleged patent, which has come to light, adds an additional layer of complexity and raises serious ethical concerns regarding knowledge held within certain circles and the potential manipulation of these findings for nefarious purposes.\nUnquestionably, these revelations demand a thorough and impartial investigation to substantiate or dismiss these claims. Governments, international organizations, and leading scientific bodies must collaborate to establish an impartial inquiry, leaving no stone unturned. This investigation should focus on identifying the precise mechanisms leading to the virus's creation and ensure accountability, while also safeguarding the integrity of scientific research.\nThe implications of this potential lab-originated virus have far-reaching consequences and expose vulnerabilities within our global systems. Public outcry is growing, demanding not only swift justice but also a reevaluation of existing protocols governing transparency and safety measures within scientific research. As the world confronts the ongoing pandemic, this newfound understanding casts a long, dark shadow over the quest to restore normalcy and raises fundamental questions about the human cost of scientific discovery.\nAs we embark on the quest for truth and understanding, it remains paramount that responsible journalism prevails, presenting the facts and avoiding the perilous pitfalls of sensationalism. It is imperative that we, as a society, seek the truth together, holding both scientific institutions and governments accountable for their actions, ensuring a future of transparency, cooperation, and ultimately a safer world for all.", 1], ["Says for otherwise healthy people \u00d2experiencing mild to moderate respiratory symptoms with or without a COVID-19 diagnosis \u00c9 only high temperatures kill a virus, so let your fever run high,\u00d3 but not over 103 or 104 degrees F.

As the world grapples with the relentless COVID-19 pandemic, these heartless impostors prey on fear, exploiting public health concerns for their selfish gains, leaving innocent citizens vulnerable in the process.\nAccording to the victims, these individuals, cunningly disguised as COVID-19 testers, are going door to door, soliciting residents to undergo crucial testing for the novel Coronavirus. Armed with what appears to be legitimate testing equipment, they exploit the trust bestowed upon healthcare workers during these uncertain times, gaining access to people's homes under the guise of safeguarding public health.\nOnce inside, these malicious impostors execute their illicit intentions, instilling terror and making off with valuable possessions, leaving victims both emotionally devastated and materially deprived. This brazen deception not only violates the sanctity of personal space but also gravely compromises the safety and wellbeing of the community.\nLocal law enforcement agencies have been swift to acknowledge and condemn this insidious trend, urging residents to remain vigilant and cautious. Authorities are proactively collaborating with community leaders to raise awareness regarding the modus operandi employed by these criminals. Simultaneously, they are employing every available resource to bring these unscrupulous individuals to justice and restore a sense of safety within Colorado Springs.\nDesperate to safeguard the community's wellbeing, local officials warn against allowing unknown individuals into homes for COVID-19 testing without proper verification. Residents are urged to verify identities, request proper credentials, and verify affiliations with established healthcare institutions. Additionally, authorities encourage citizens to report any suspicious behavior or incidents related to the unlawful COVID-19 testing and robbery scheme, thereby actively aiding in the apprehension of these criminals.\nThe emergence of this nefarious trend emphasizes the growing severity of the predicaments faced by communities during these uncertain times. As the pandemic continues to cast its menacing shadow, it exposes society's vulnerabilities in the face of those who exploit disaster for personal gain. Colorado Springs now stands united in the pursuit of justice and the restoration of security, striving to safeguard its residents from the twin threats of COVID-19 and criminal exploitation.\nIn the wake of this distressing development, it is imperative for citizens to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and exhibit compassion, supporting one another in these testing times. Together, we can endure these challenges and eventually triumph over adversity, upholding the principles of compassion, unity, and integrity that define the resilient spirit of Colorado Springs.", 1], ["According to a post, the usage of a significant amount of vitamin C can potentially slow down or halt the spread of the coronavirus promptly.", 1], ["Title: Examining the Severity of COVID-19: Fact vs. Fiction\nAmidst the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been conjectures and theories surrounding the magnitude of its impact, with some suggesting that the outbreak is comparable to previous election year health crises. These claims propose a narrative that argues the new coronavirus is being exaggerated, potentially intending to impede the political trajectory of President Donald Trump. However, an objective analysis of the available data and expert opinions highlights the severity and distinctiveness of COVID-19, underscoring the importance of comprehensive public health measures.\nWhile it is true that health crises have occasionally coincided with election years in the past, it is erroneous to assimilate the current pandemic to such patterns. Drawing comparisons between COVID-19 and prior outbreaks fails to account for the unprecedented scale and global impact of the novel coronavirus. Dismissing the dire consequences and scientific evidence surrounding the virus undermines the broader context of this uniquely challenging situation.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and various leading health experts have consistently alerted the world about the severity of COVID-19. Its highly contagious nature, significant morbidity and mortality rates, as well as the strain it puts on healthcare systems, have been repeatedly emphasized. The global response, considered the most substantial since the Spanish flu over a century ago, underscores the gravity of this ongoing health crisis.\nFurthermore, the international medical community has extensively studied and analyzed COVID-19 to ascertain the risks it poses. Comprehensive research and rigorous scientific methodologies have substantiated the virulence of the disease, debunking any suggestion that it is being deliberately exaggerated. Holding this view essentially disregards the countless lives lost, disrupted societies, and extensive economic ramifications inflicted by the pandemic.\nIt is crucial to emphasize that the response to the COVID-19 outbreak is not influenced by political motivations alone. Governments, healthcare systems, and public health organizations globally have mobilized resources to protect lives and mitigate the spread of the virus. To suggest that the pandemic is a calculated exaggeration deployed to impact election results not only undermines the tireless efforts of healthcare professionals but also distracts from the need for collective action and unity during these difficult times.\nIn conclusion, the notion that COVID-19 is simply another election year health crisis, hyped to harm a political figure, is unfounded and misleading. This pandemic, characterized by its unprecedented global reach, extensive public health measures, and significant loss of life, demands our utmost attention and unified efforts to curb its spread. Relying on factual information, heeding expert advice, and acknowledging the seriousness of the situation will be paramount as societies around the world navigate these turbulent times, promoting the health and well-being of all, regardless of political affiliations.", 1], ["In response to the ongoing health concerns surrounding COVID-19, supermarkets have initiated a recall procedure for toilet paper that has been potentially exposed to the virus.", 1], ["Jada Pinkett Smith is denying she is a Scientologist after former member Leah Remini claimed she was one.

Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice. Reward Challenge: A designated runner will have to race through a series of obstacles to dig up three sets of keys. Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe. Additionally, the losing tribe will be forced to forfeit their fishing kit. However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit. For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti\u2019s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe\u2019s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris\u2019s decision to forfeit the opening challenge. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe will have to race across a net bridge to where two bags are hanging. Working together, they will then need to untie the bags to obtain a pair of ropes. Using the ropes, the tribe will need to slide a sled full of big puzzle pieces through a course. At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity. Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra\u2019s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe\u2019s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out. At Naviti, Domenick searched for a hidden immunity idol in the middle of the night, which he eventually found; it was revealed to be Andrea\u2019s idol from Caramoan. The next morning, he attempted to bury the hatchet with Chris, but the tension still lingered between the two. Domenick told Chris he found an idol moments after telling him the opposite, which caused Chris to distrust him. At Malolo, Jacob kept the legacy advantage information to himself and told his tribemates he found an idol on Ghost Island, but that he had left the paper behind, making Brendan suspicious.

USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage \u2014 and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  \u201cThis is my real life,\" he said. \"I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn\u2019t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.\"  \"Things start happening that the public can see,\u201d he continued. \u201cThen we had to get to a point of \u2018Okay, tear this down and let\u2019s start from the beginning' \u2026 It\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  \u201cI was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years \u2013 13 years,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAll of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.\"  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup \"the most painful experience I\u2019ve had in my life, like, with a person I\u2019ve loved with all of my heart,\" and denied the rumors \"that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.\u201d  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.  For Jay fans hoping to see 4:44 live, the rapper announced a 31-city tour on Monday, which kicks off in October.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uMsLVv", 0], ["CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald J.

(Photo: Martin Bureau, AFP/Getty Images)  C\u00e9line Dion's hearing is putting a temporary stop to her singing.  The superstar singer Wednesday took to social media to announce the cancellation of March and April concert dates in Las Vegas, saying she plans to undergo \"a minimally invasive surgical procedure\" to correct an ear condition that causes hearing irregularities.  The singer, who canceled two January concerts due to a \"lingering cold,\" apologized to her fans: \u201cMy luck hasn\u2019t been very good lately. \u2026 I\u2019ve been so looking forward to doing my shows again and this happens. \u2026 I just can\u2019t believe it! I apologize to everyone who planned to travel to Las Vegas to see my show. I know how disappointing this is, and I\u2019m so sorry.\"  The announcement said concerts scheduled from March 27 to April 18 at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace have been canceled. It goes on to offer details for ticket refunds.  The concerts will resume as scheduled on May 22.  The Facebook announcement goes on to explain the reason: \"C\u00e9line has been dealing with a condition in her middle ear known as Patulous Eustachian tube, which causes hearing irregularities, and makes it extremely difficult to sing.\"  According to the message, the singer has been experiencing the condition for more than a year. Ear drop medications that had successfully treated the condition stopped working recently, leading to the surgery decision.  Although Dion had to cancel two January shows, she did have a special guest fan at one of her performances: Adele.  I had a pretty rough time during the last couple of weeks...a lot of people have been hit with cold and flu bugs... but I'm doing much better now.

It is the sixty-sixth episode of the series overall. It premiered on August 20, 2017. It was written by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss and directed by Alan Taylor. Contents show] Plot Jon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future. Summary At Winterfell At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death. Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay. Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear. Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice. The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr.

We will be posting the transcript and our annotations through the night. Follow us on Medium and check back regularly to see our commentary.RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them into working on behalf of our country.I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potent", 0], ["The 2017 MTV Video Music Awards are making a much-anticipated return to the West Coast!

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city\u2019s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project \u2014 billionaire developer Donald Trump \u2014 put himself at the center of the nation\u2019s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines \u2014 and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him \u2014 when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and \u201crapists\u201d crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump\u2019s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs \u2014 while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail.

Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.\u201cMost of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,\u201d said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country\u2019s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.\u201cHe might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,\u201d Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York.

The project, starring Tony winner Ben Platt (Dear Evan Hansen), with Oscar winners Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow in negotiations to co-star, has received a two-season straight-to-series order, I hear.  The deal, believed to be the biggest TV package sale of the year, came after a weeklong bidding war among top streaming players, including Amazon and Hulu, sources said. It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.  RESX/Shutterstock  As he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow\u2019s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.  Details about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt\u2019s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.  Rex/Shutterstock  I hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show. That, along with the potential involvement of Paltrow and Streisand, helped drive interest in the project, sparking a heated bidding and leading to the big Netflix deal.  Frequent collaborators Falchuk and Murphy had been quietly working on the script for The Politician for the past year. The two brought in their Glee co-creator Brennan, with the three expected to share co-creator credit. Platt also was attached early on and is heavily involved in the casting of the series, which eyes a potential late summer production start.  The project hails from Fox 21 TV Studios under Murphy\u2019s overall deal at 20th Century Fox TV. Its packaging was guided by Fox TV Group chairman Dana Walden, a longtime Murphy collaborator who oversees the studio.  Paltrow previously worked on Falchuk, Murphy and Brennan\u2019s Glee. The actress, who is engaged to Falchuk, won an Emmy for her guest-starring role on Fox\u2019s high school musical dramedy.  The deal for The Politician comes on the heels of the successful launch of Falchuk and Murphy\u2019s latest collaboration, drama series 9-1-1 (co-created with Tim Minear), which has been a breakout hit for Fox and was renewed for a second season only two episodes into its freshman run. The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk\u2019s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX\u2019s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals). Murphy is also the mastermind behind FX\u2019s American Crime Story and Feud as well as Netflix\u2019s upcoming Ratched starring Emmy winner Sarah Paulson (AHS franchise, People v. O.J. Simpson) as a younger version of the diabolical Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.  Netflix  Netflix has emerged as the streaming home of Murphy by snagging both of his series to hit the premium space in the past five months. The latest development is sure to further fuel speculation about the future of Murphy, one of the top creator-producers working in television today who has pulled off the rare feat of launching commercial and award-winning hits on both broadcast and cable. Netflix has been widely rumored to be among a slew of suitors for Murphy, whose current deal with 20th Century Fox TV expires later this year.  \u201cI haven\u2019t made a decision of where I\u2019m going to go, I\u2019m going to sit back and wait,\u201d Murphy said at TCA last month when asked whether he would stay at the studio, which is in the process of being acquired by Disney.

Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.Story Continued BelowAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.The most reliable politics newsletter.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best.

The streaming giant has handed out a 10-episode, straight-to-series order for vampire drama V-Wars, based on the IDW novel of the same name, with the Vampire Diaries alum set to star. The order comes as another IDW property, the beloved Locke and Key, is awaiting word on a new home after Hulu's surprising pass on the pilot.  V-Wars revolves around Dr. Luther Swann (Somerhalder), who enters a world of horror when a mysterious disease transforms his best friend, Michael Fayne, into a murderous predator who feeds on other humans. As the disease spreads and more people are transformed, society fractures into opposing camps pitting normal people against the growing number of these vampires. Swann races against time to understand what\u2019s happening, while Fayne rises to become the powerful underground leader of the vampires.  The series is based on IDW Publishing's V-Wars franchise, written by New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Maberry. High Park Entertainment produces alongside IDW Entertainment, which will distribute the series worldwide (excluding Canada). 1-800-Missing creators William Laurin and Glenn Davis will serve as showrunners. Brad Turner (Stargate, Stargate Atlantis) will direct and exec produce. High Park's Eric Birnberg and Thomas Walden will exec produce alongside IDW Entertainment president David Ozer, IDW CEO Ted Adams and Marada Pictures' James Gibb.  \"We could not have dreamed of a better choice than Ian Somerhalder to bring his keen understanding of this genre from his years of starring in The Vampire Diaries to lead the cast of V-Wars as Dr. Luther Swann and to be a creative force on this series, as well as to serve as a director this season. We are thrilled to partner with Netflix to bring the multifaceted world that Jonathan Maberry created to audiences worldwide.\"  V-Wars was first announced in 2014 as part of a straight-to-series deal with Entertainment One. That company, as well as the drama's original writer and producers Circle of Confusion are no longer attached. The pickup comes as IDW's Locke and Key is being shopped to other streaming outlets, among others, as the company looks to find a new home for the Carlton Cuse drama based on Joe Hill's beloved comic series. Despite multiple attempts to bring the series to both the big and small screen, IDW remains committed to finding the project a creative home.  For Somerhalder, meanwhile, V-Wars arrives a year after he signed off of The CW's Vampire Diaries following its eight-season run. He currently has a pod deal with TVD producers Warner Bros. Television with actress Nikki Reed, his wife, via their Rare Bird Productions banner. He is repped by ICM Partners, Untitled Entertainment and Morris Yorn.  V-Wars arrives as Netflix continues to spend an estimated $8 billion annually on original programming. The genre drama joins a roster of Marvel fare including the recently renewed Jessica Jones and gives the streamer a series vampire drama as The CW is prepping the final season of Vampire Diaries spinoff The Originals, while working on yet another offshoot from the franchise. The genre remains popular with NBC's Midnight, Texas, and Syfy's Van Helsing, among others.", 0], ["Mariah Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You' Hits Hot 100's Top 10 for First Time, 'Perfect' Still No. 1 The holiday classic, released in 1994, dashes from No. 11 to No. 9. Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran & Beyonc\u00e9's \"Perfect\" leads for a second week and Migos, Nicki Minaj & Cardi B's \"MotorSport\" also zooms to the top 10. Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" hits the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 at last, jingling from No. 11 (its prior peak) to No. 9 on the chart dated Dec. 30. The modern yuletide classic reaches the top 10 for the first time 23 years after its 1994 release. Atop the Hot 100, Ed Sheeran and Beyonc\u00e9's \"Perfect\" reigns for a second week. Plus, Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B's \"MotorSport\" accelerates 15-6 for its first week in the top 10 following the premiere of its official video. As we do every Monday, let's run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends all-genre streaming, airplay and sales data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 19). Let's start with a blizzard of chart stats about Carey's \"Christmas.\" Streams, Sales & Plays: First, the numbers that result in \"Christmas\" (on Columbia/Legacy Records and co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff) hitting the Hot 100's top 10. The song gains by 4 percent to 25.2 million U.S. streams in the week ending Dec. 14, according to Nielsen Music; dips 8 percent to 19,000 downloads sold in the same tracking span; and lifts 28 percent to 34 million in airplay audience in the week ending Dec. 17. Those totals place \"Christmas\" at No. 7 on the Streaming Songs chart, No. 13 on Digital Song Sales and No. 36 on Radio Songs. Notably, streaming is the most prominent driver of the song, accounting for 70 percent of its chart points this week. Carey's 28th Top 10: Carey collects her 28th Hot 100 top 10. \"Christmas\" is her first since \"Obsessed\" reached No. 7 in 2009. She tallied 19 top 10s in the 1990s and eight in the 2000s. (Of those, 18 hit No. 1, the most among soloists; only The Beatles have more, with 20.) Carey ties Stevie Wonder for the fifth-most Hot 100 top 10s in the chart's history (which dates to its Aug. 4, 1958, inception): Most Top 10 Hot 100 Hits 38, Madonna 34, The Beatles 31, Rihanna 29, Michael Jackson 28, Mariah Carey 28, Stevie Wonder 27, Janet Jackson 27, Elton John Top 10s in the '90s, '00s & '10s: Carey joins an elite list of acts with Hot 100 top 10s in the '90s, '00s & '10s. Its previously-inducted members: Christina Aguilera, Dr. Dre, Whitney Houston, Enrique Iglesias, Michael Jackson, JAY-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears and Usher. Two of those acts boast streaks dating even further back than the '90s: Jackson ('70s-'10s) and Madonna ('80s-'10s). (As for Houston, she charted top 10s in the '80s, '90s and '00s and re-sent her 1992-93 No. 1 \"I Will Always Love You\" to No. 3 in 2012 following her passing that February. All the other acts above sent at least one song to the top 10 for the first time in each decade.) 'Christmas' in the Top 10: Perhaps surprisingly, Carey charts one of the few holiday top 10s in the Hot 100's history. \"The Chipmunk Song\" by The Chipmunks with David Seville led for four weeks beginning Dec. 22, 1958; Dan Fogelberg's \"Same Old Lang Syne\" reached No. 9 in February 1981 (after debuting in December 1980); and New Kids on the Block's \"This One's for the Children\" rose to No. 7 in the 1989-90 holiday season. No other such song reached the top 10 until Kenny G's \"Auld Lang Syne\" (No. 7, Jan. 8, 2000). Between that New Year's Eve anthem and Carey's \"Christmas,\" Justin Bieber came closest to the top 10 with \"Mistletoe,\" which hit No. 11 (Jan. 5, 2011). Carey's hit is, thus, the first Hot 100 top 10 with the word \"Christmas\" in its title. Notably, for several years in the Hot 100's history (1963-72; 1983-85, barring occasional exceptions), holiday songs were not eligible to chart, instead appearing on separate holiday rankings.

According to People , Amber's tweets came in response to actor Armie Hammer tweeting to Woods, \"Didn't you date a 19 year old when you were 60.......?\" following Woods's criticism of Armie's upcoming film, in which he plays a 24-year-old dating a 17-year-old.  \"James Woods tried to pick me and my friend up at a restaurant once. He wanted to take us to Vegas. 'I'm 16' I said. 'Even better' he said,\" Amber tweeted.  Woods has since denounced Amber's tweet as a lie , to which Amber responded with a screenshot of a text in which she asked a friend if they remembered the time Woods allegedly tried to pick them up as teens.  \"Damn totally forgot about that,\" the friend replied.  Many on Twitter have responded to the allegations, some supporting Amber and making allegations of their own.  James, however, equated much of the response to his initial tweet about Armie Hammer's movie, Call Me by Your Name , to \"trolls,\" even adding that he likes Armie as an actor.  Teen Vogue received an open letter from Amber Tamblyn to James Woods, which is printed in full below. We've reached out to Woods's agent, but we haven't yet been able to connect.  Dear Mr. Woods,  What you are experiencing is called a teachable moment. It is called a gift. It is called a humbling. It is called Jesus, I come to thee. It is called an awakening. It is called a growth edge. It is called hope.  The hope being that through this experience, you can change. You can redefine the man who will come after this moment and this man who came before.  Since you've now called me a liar, I will now call you a silencer. I see your gaslight and now will raise you a scorched earth.  My friend Billy and I were at the Roxy on Sunset Boulevard seeing a band we loved. We decided to go to Mel's diner on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood to get burgers after. I had just gotten my driver's license and very specifically remember my nervousness trying to park in the diner parking lot. Upon leaving the restaurant we were stopped by you and your friend, who both seemed very nice. At one point you suggested we should all go to Las Vegas together. \"It's such a great place, have you ever been?\" You tried to make it sound innocent. This is something predatory men like to do, I've noticed. Make it sound innocent. Just a dollop of insinuation. Just a hair of persuasion. Just a pinch of suggestion. \"It will be so much fun, I promise you. Nothing has to happen, we will just have a good time together.\" I told you my age, kindly and with no judgment or aggression. I told you my age because I thought you would be immediately horrified and take back your offer. You laughed and said, \"Even better. We'll have so much fun, I promise.\"  Here's the thing, Mr. Woods. At that time I was not a public persona. I had done a couple years on a soap opera as an actress, but you wouldn't know me from Adam. I'm sure you've racked your brain trying to remember how you could've possibly hit on the actress Amber Tamblyn at a diner almost two decades ago. You think, it's not possible, there's no way I would've been so stupid as to hit on a 16-year-old known actress. But I wasn't known then, James. I was just a girl. And I'm going to wager that there have been many girls who were just girls or women who were just women who you've done this to because you can get away with it.  The saddest part of this story doesn't even concern me but concerns the universal woman's story. The nation's harmful narrative of disbelieving women first, above all else. Asking them to first corroborate or first give proof or first make sure we're not misremembering or first consider the consequences of speaking out or first let men give their side or first just let your sanity come last.

His books are occupying six of the top 10 spots on Amazon's bestsellers list, a sign of immense interest in reading or re-reading his books like \"Kitchen Confidential.\"  And some of his past TV shows are re-airing in his honor.  On Friday there were pop-up tributes outside Les Halles, the New York restaurant where Bourdain worked in the 1990s. Fans left bouquets and handwritten messages on the walls and door of the shuttered French brasserie.  At CNN in Atlanta, a mourner placed a flower and a note next to a poster of Bourdain in the lobby. And at CNN in New York, an employee placed post-it notes with hearts on one of his posters.  CNN was Bourdain's home for the past five years, so the loss has caused heartache throughout the organization. The network quickly produced an hour-long remembrance that premiered on Friday night and will re-air Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.  Related: Inside Anthony Bourdain's globe-trotting career  Other CNN programs are also honoring Bourdain's legacy.  \"It is hard to imagine he is gone,\" Anderson Cooper said Friday night. \"Hard to imagine he is not just off on some far away journey, hard to imagine he will not soon return with new foods to share, new stories to tell.\"  Before Bourdain died, CNN had planned to run a marathon of past \"Parts Unknown\" episodes on Saturday night. The network is moving forward with that plan, but with an adjustment -- the marathon will feature some of Bourdain's all-time favorite episodes.  Additionally, the Travel Channel will air a 12-hour marathon of Bourdain's previous show \"No Reservations\" on Sunday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern.  A new episode of \"Parts Unknown\" featuring Berlin was already scheduled to premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. CNN says it will still air, but now \"with a special introduction by Anderson Cooper.\"  That episode will be followed by the tribute special.  Related: How the press can cover suicide without creating a 'contagion'  \"Somebody as vital, as passionate, as alive, as warm as human as Tony Bourdain, I could not imagine, A, that he was gone, and B, that he was gone in this manner,\" Christiane Amanpour said in an interview for the special.  She said his death has \"left a massive hole in\" the world.  The manner of Bourdain's death has also caused CNN and many other news outlets to highlight suicide prevention resources.  All three network nightly newscasts in the U.S. featured the \"lifeline\" number, 800-273-8255, and encouraged people to call for help.  CNN and CNN.com have also been prominently featuring the number.  \"You never know what goes on in anybody's head and you never really know what goes on anyone's heart,\" Cooper said in the CNN tribute.  \"But certainly, you know, the pain he must have been feeling, at least in that moment or in those moments, and the loneliness he must've been feeling -- it's just terribly sad to think about. And makes me very sad for him to have -- to have succumbed to that.\"  Asking for help  The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. It's now the 10th leading cause of death in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK  There is also a crisis text line.  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.", 0], ["Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Gina Vivinetto  Idina Menzel can light up both the Broadway stage and the silver screen, but when she revealed she married fianc\u00e9 Aaron Lohr over the weekend, she was anything but dramatic.  \"Wanted to let you know...Married the love of my life #aaronlohr this weekend @ our home,\" the 46-year-old Broadway actress and \"Frozen\" star tweeted on Monday. \"Dad & son walked me down aisle.

Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen \u2014 who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring \"both triggering and emotionally exhausting\") \u2014 alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during \"a dark time in my life.\" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with \"the aftermath of the rape.\"  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, \"I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.\"  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when \"Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'\" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling \"to smooth everything over\" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  \"I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,\" Cohen alleges. \"I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn\u2019t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.\"  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. \"I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,\" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her \"I can\u2019t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there\u2019s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don\u2019t want to be 'that girl.'\"  Cohen continued that she now realizes \"the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others.\" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  \"There is a bigger picture to this \u2014 cleaning out the system and creating radical change,\" Cohen told THR. \"I think that's what I'm contributing to. That's the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration.

The ex-Miss Great Britain paired up with Thomas Powell on the ITV2 show in 2016 before forming a relationship with Katie Salmon to become its first same-sex couple. She was found dead at her parents\u2019 home in Ponteland, Northumberland, on Wednesday evening. Police said they do not believe there are \u201cany suspicious circumstances\u201d surrounding Sophie\u2019s death. Sophie\u2019s boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, along with her friends and family, confirmed she had passed away. (Image: Facebook) (Image: WENN / ITV2) Sharing a tender last picture of them together, Aaron wrote: \"I will never forget that smile I love you so so much baby your my world forever ever and always\" Love Island host Caroline Flack said: \u201cSo very sad. Such a beautiful soul, such a beautiful smile. Thoughts and love with friends and family.\u201d She had told fans she had mental health problems last year, writing on Twitter: \u201cHi guys, no not dead just battling a little bit of depression. I\u2019ll come back I promise.\u201d In another tweet, she said she was \u201ca total recluse... afraid to go out because of crippling anxiety\u201d. The reality star, who hailed from Newcastle, was crowned Miss Great Britain in 2009 and was also a former Miss Newcastle. (Image: ITV) But she found wider fame as part of the 2016 Love Island cast. A representative for Love Island said: \"The whole ITV2 and Love Island team are profoundly saddened to hear the news about Sophie, and our deepest sympathies and thoughts go to her family and friends.\" A tribute was paid to former Love Island star Sophie Gradon just before Thursday's episode. The words: \"In loving memory of Sophie Gradon\" were accompanied by a picture of the late 32-year-old smiling. Her Love Island friends shared a string of moving tributes after the shock news of her death emerged. (Image: ITV) Sophie had been tweeting along with the current series and supporting her pal Ellie Brown, who joined the show last week. Sophie had also talked about her boyfriend on Twitter just two days ago, calling him the love of her life. Sharing a video of him playing with his pet dog, she wrote: \"When the love of your life loves his dogs like this you know he\u2019s the one. She\u2019s cuddling him right back ... & those arms\" The couple, who confirmed their relationship on Facebook on May 29, had recently returned from a holiday in southern France, where they'd been to celebrate his birthday.

She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let\u2019s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?  Rachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn\u2019t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn\u2019t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.  \u201cI wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing \u2026 So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.\u201d  And, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. \u201cFor me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cAnd I really haven\u2019t talked to him because I don\u2019t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he\u2019s doing well too.\u201d  Peter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel\u2019s dog, which is very important.)  The number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, \u201cWe haven\u2019t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that\u2019s the plan. 2018, it\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d He explained that even though Rachel \u201cisn\u2019t much of a planner,\u201d the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. \u201cWe would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cI think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.\u201d  I would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair\u2019s impending nuptials. \u201cGood music. I\u2019m very big on \u2018I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.\u2019 I know it\u2019s like our day, but it\u2019s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that\u2019s a must-have. No roses. We\u2019re done. Those days are over.\u201d  No roses is probably a good idea \u2014 she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel\u2019s finale, there\u2019s no doubt \u2014 she and Bryan are still in love, and they don\u2019t care who knows it.", 0], ["The happiest place on Earth officially just became the most mythical, too.

Barack Obama faced off at Hofstra University Wednesday night in their last debate before Election Day. Bob Schieffer of CBS was the moderator. Here is a transcript of the debate.Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain debate face to face Wednesday night.Schieffer: Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.The rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion.I'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.Gentlemen, welcome.By now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard. Let's get to it.Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.Sen. McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.Sen. Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.I will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?Sen. McCain, you go first.McCain: Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.And thanks to Hofstra.And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.It's good to see you again, Sen. Obama.Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry. They're hurting, and they're angry. They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.Now, I know the criticism of this.Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned. And so we've got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.Schieffer: All right. Sen. Obama?Obama: Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Sen. McCain again, and thank you, Bob.I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Sen.

Good to see you.So, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts.If they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples.PlayThat will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.Ben Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right?GEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output.We think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible.Now, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits.TAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth?GEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth.TAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples --GEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful.TAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress?GEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand.TAPPER: So, before the election?GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely.TAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth.Are you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America?GEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will.TAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen?GEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis.TAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative.

Since then, the story has developed continuously, with a large number of women coming forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein - allegations he has denied. Here is a summary of the events so far: 5 October 2017 The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward. Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours. Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he \"has caused a lot of pain\" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. Weinstein's lawyer tells The Hollywood Reporter his client is preparing to sue the New York Times. Weinstein says he is taking a \"leave of absence\" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist. 6 October 2017 Brie Larson and Lena Dunham are among those to react to the allegations in the article, praising the bravery of those who have come forward. The Weinstein Company says it takes the allegations \"extremely seriously\" and is launching an inquiry. 7 October 2017 Weinstein's lawyer Lisa Bloom announces her resignation, saying she understands that \"Mr Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement\". 8 October 2017 It is announced that Harvey Weinstein has been sacked by the board of his company, with immediate effect. They say the decision was made \"in light of new information about misconduct\". 9 October 2017 10 October 2017 Allegations from 13 more women are published in the New Yorker magazine, including three accusations of rape, which Weinstein strongly denies. Actress Asia Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Stoller say Weinstein forced himself on them sexually. A third woman withholds her name from the article, the result of a 10-month investigation by the magazine. Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004. Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: \"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein.\" Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie say they were harassed by Weinstein. Paltrow says she was propositioned as a 22-year-old, while Jolie refers to a \"bad experience\" in her youth. Other figures to speak out against Weinstein include Barack Obama, Benedict Cumberbatch and Leonardo DiCaprio. Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announces she is leaving him and that her priority is her young children. 11 October 2017 Bafta says it is suspending Weinstein's membership, with immediate effect. A number of senior Labour MPs call for Weinstein's honorary CBE to be taken away. Prime Minister Theresa May says a decision about the honour would not lie with Downing Street. Cara Delevingne also says Weinstein made advances towards her. A statement from the Cannes Film Festival says organisers are \"dismayed\" to learn of the allegations about Weinstein. 12 October 2017 Overnight, police are called following a \"family dispute\" at the home of Weinstein's daughter. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirms they were called to reports of a \"disturbance\" at the house but say no crime was committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived.

Black sums it up nicely: \"He was just trouble.\"  They tried dating in high school but soon were separated by distance, with Bentley moving to Nashville at 19 years of age and Black working at an advertising firm in San Francisco, Calif.

Diddy\u2019s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack\u2019s former producer Alvin Toney.  \u201cCraig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,\u201d Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. \u201cYou always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.\u201d  Mack is best known for the indelible classic \u201cFlava in Ya Ear,\u201d \u2013 a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies \u2013 and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. \u201cCraig is hip-hop\u2019s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,\u201d Diddy once told The New York Times. \u201cHe does what\u2019s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.\u201d  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. \u201cI knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,\u201d Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. \u201cAll the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,\u201d he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: \u201cJust Rhymin'\u201d b/w \u201cGet Retarded.\u201d The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single \u201cZoom.\u201d Mack eventually met Diddy \u2013 who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records \u2013 outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with \u201cFlava in Ya Ear\u201d and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy\u2019s hit \u201cI Need a Girl Part 1,\u201d but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group\u2019s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. \u201cCraig Mack is dead,\u201d Stair tells the congregation. \u201cWe have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.\u201d  In Can\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs\u2019 revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody was disappointed,\u201d Combs told Billboard last year. \u201cWe kind of respected his wishes.

But, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to be shot.The outrage in Ferguson is understandable\u2014though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. \u2026 Police look inward. They\u2019re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It\u2019s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.The Cato Institute\u2019s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (\u201c\u2018This my property!\u2019 he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.\u201d) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that \u201cWe rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone\u201d?Olson added, \u201cthe dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.\u201dHow did this happen?Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.There is a systemic problem with today\u2019s law enforcement.Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies\u2014where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, \u201cthe Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.\u201dBernick continued, \u201cfederal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.\u201dBernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, \u201ctoday, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country\u2014tanks included.\u201dWhen you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury\u2014national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture\u2014we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many", 0], ["Perry also defended Osteen in his Facebook video. \"I know there's been some controversy about Joel Osteen and him not opening the doors of the church,\u201d Perry said in the video. \"Let me tell you something: Joel and [his wife] Victoria are amazing people.

And no one\u2019s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice. So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she\u2019s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she\u2019d like to be excluded)? Acid gossip that borrows from better songs \u2013 Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do review Read more Release a music video \u2013 for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do \u2013 that\u2019s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s reputation\u201d. Yes, it\u2019s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift\u2019s brand hasn\u2019t exactly been built on subtlety. Look What You Made Me Do \u2013 or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates \u2013 is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn\u2019t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift\u2019s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name \u2013 singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment \u2013 in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone\u2019s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. \u201cShe can\u2019t come to the phone right now,\u201d Swift 2.0 says. Why? \u201cBecause she\u2019s dead.\u201d In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night\u2019s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that\u2019s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it\u2019s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyonc\u00e9 dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn\u2019t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, \u201cI know what you think of me\u201d, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: \u201cI\u2019m a messy bitch who lives for drama.\u201d But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song\u2019s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave. Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift\u2019s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading \u201cNils Sjoberg\u201d, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris\u2019s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift\u2019s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for \u201csomeone new to try and bury\u201d.

I\u2019ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201dMother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiser\u2014where he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in public\u2014and has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination.

But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, \u201cHad he been born of Mexican parents, I\u2019d have a better shot of winning this.\u201d Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, \u201cI have inherited nothing.\u201d He remarked, \u201cThere is a perception, \u2018Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.\u2019 Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.\u201dRomney told the contributors that \u201cwomen are open to supporting me,\u201d but that \u201cwe are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we\u2019re in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.\u201d When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, \u201cFrankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.\u201d He added, \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m either tied or close to the president\u2026that\u2019s very interesting.\u201dAsked why he wouldn\u2019t go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:We speak with voters across the country about their perceptions.

Now that's not going to happen. We're going to -- it's become a piggy bank.PETER ORSZAG, OMB DIRECTOR: Well, Senator...GREGG: It's a piggy bank which adds to our deficit, adds to our debt and gets put (INAUDIBLE) tax.ORSZAG: The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity. And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets. One of the -- and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses. It's why in this budget, we're...GREGG: No, no, no!

Thank you very much.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, thank you for letting us come to your office.GREGG: Appreciate you coming in.VAN SUSTEREN: All right, today you had quite a showdown with the -- with Peter Orszag.GREGG: Well, you know, they've sent up a budget which by their own terms is unsustainable. It puts us on a path which is basically going to lead us to fiscal insolvency as a nation, in my opinion, and I think in a lot of other people's opinion. It's a huge deficit machine, is what they've proposed, and that leads to debt. And the debt is not sustainable. It gets passed on to our kids, and basically, will lower the quality of life of our children, and that's not fair.I feel very strongly that when you send a budget like that up, you should also send up some fairly big ideas for how you're going to address it in the out years, how you're going to keep us from going off the road, how you're going to keep us from passing on to our kids a nation that can be afforded. And there are no big ideas in this budget on the issue of fiscal discipline. None. There are some -- there are some ideas, and I support their freeze concept. But the freeze is $10 billion. Compared to a $1.6 trillion deficit, it's really not going to get us there.VAN SUSTEREN: Well, one of the things that he brought up that, obviously, you were quite heated about, was the whole idea of taking some of the returned TARP money and giving it to community banks to the tune of $30 billion for lending.

On behalf of CNN, Univision and the candidates, we want to thank our hosts, the University of Texas and the LBJ School and Library.And now I want to give you an idea of what to expect over the next 90 minutes or so. We want to have a real conversation between these two candidates on the issues important to Texas and the entire nation, so we won't have any hard and fast rules for them to follow. We simply ask the candidates to keep their answers to a reasonable length and to stay on point.And we have given the candidates the opportunity to make opening statements. The order was determined by a draw. Senator Obama won the draw and elected to go second.So please go ahead, Senator Clinton.SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, thank you.And I am just delighted to be back here in Austin. You know, nearly 36 years ago I came to Austin for my very first political job, and that was registering voters in south Texas. And I had the great privilege of living for a while in Austin and in San Antonio, and meeting people and making friends that have stayed with me for a lifetime.And I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.CLINTON: And among the people whom I got to know, who became not only friends, but heroes, were Barbara Jordan, who taught me a lot about courage, and today...(APPLAUSE)...would actually be her birthday. I remember all the time about how she got up every single morning, facing almost insurmountable odds, to do what she did.And another was my great friend Ann Richards, who taught me so much...(APPLAUSE)... about determination. Ann was a great champion for the people of Texas. She also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is we're engaged in.And as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere.CLINTON: You know, 350,000 children in Texas get health care every month because I helped to start the Children's Health Insurance Program.(APPLAUSE)And 21,000 National Guard and Reserve members get access to health care because I went across the party line and joined up with a Republican senator to make that happen.So there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do.I want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people.And we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more.(APPLAUSE)And I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans.CLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us.And there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable.(APPLAUSE)And I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign.

At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,\" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. \"But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.\"ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation \u2014 sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) \u2014 to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.\"If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,\" she said, \"we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.\"The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.\"When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,\" Pelosi said. \"It's time for it to be increased again.\"", 0], ["\"Access denied | www.webmd.com used Cloudflare to restrict access\" this website is using security service to protect itself from online attacks ..

The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden \u2014 or so he hopes \u2014 as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night\u2019s Late Late Show.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed \u201cJames Street,\u201d group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d changing it to \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d to reflect Corden\u2019s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.  Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag \"#Jamesstreet.\"  In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the \u201cLarger Than Life\u201d single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. \"Corden's back, alright,\" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan.  While Kevin Richardson explained to Corden that no one was going to opt out of the performance, the late-night host responded, \"How hard is it? What is being a Backstreet Boy? It's wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it.\"  Following Brian Littrell's insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell's place onstage. \"Show me the meaning of being lonely,\" Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room.  Following Littrell's forced departure, Corden tried to learn the choreography for the performance. He also took the liberty of suggesting new dance moves. When asked when he should do the worm, Howie Dorough responded, \"Maybe after the show.\"  Despite resistance from the bandmembers, Corden eventually took on the role of choreographer and incorporated a number of new dance moves, including the band lifting him up during \"Larger Than Life.\" When they perfected the lift, Corden instructed, \"And then you guys disappear 'til the end of the song.\"  Not only did Corden take over for the performance, but he also attended the band's meet and greet. When taking a group photo with a fan, Corden flipped the iPhone camera and instead took a selfie. He then blocked a fan in another photo.  Corden led a prayer circle before he and the Backstreet Boys took the stage. \"Dear Lord, heavenly Jesus. I know what you're thinking. What's Brian doing there? We're thinking the same,\" he said. \"Make us strong. Show us the meaning of being lonely. Quit playing games with out hearts. Give us the call and know that everybody.\" After a moment of silence, he added, \"I can't think of any other Backstreet Boys songs. We want it that way. We want it that way!\"  The sketch then cut to the performance, in which a photo of Littrell onstage was been replaced with one of Corden. The band then appeared and began to sing \"Larger Than Life\" while the musicians are suspended on platforms in the air. Littrell eventually joined the group onstage. Corden then ran to the front of the stage and showed off his best dance moves, including the running man and the worm, as the band sang behind him.  The performance concluded when Corden thanked fans for coming and told them to drive home safe. Richardson then explained that they had 22 more songs to perform. \"I quit the band,\" Corden responded before walking offstage.  Amid the release of their new single \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart,\u201d the band is also headlining a Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.

In fact, both were seeing other people at the time and it would be several years before the pair coupled up to become one of Hollywood\u2019s most enduring relationships. Although their characters Alex P. Keaton and Ellen Reed were loved up on Family Ties, in real life Pollan was in a serious long-term relationship with Kevin Bacon and Fox was dating Facts of Life actress Nancy McKeon. \"I always thought [Tracy] was cool,\" Fox told People years later, \"but it was like a couple of married people who worked together and liked each other.\" It wasn\u2019t until 1987 when the Pollen and Fox worked together in a movie called Bright Lights, Big City that a romance began to blossom. Pollan told Winfrey in 2002: \"From the beginning, I loved his sense of humour and that brain of his. He's so smart.\" Fox told People in 1989 of hearing that Pollen and Bacon had split: \"It sounds really horrible, but it was one of those things. Someone goes, 'Did you hear that so-and-so aren't together anymore?' and you go, 'Hmm, that's too bad. Where's the phone?'\" Seven months after they started dating, he proposed on December 26, 1987. \"I wasn't really worried that she would say no,\" he recalled. \"The toughest part was trying to figure out when to get married, and then to figure out how nobody else could know about it.\" The couple tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony at Vermont's West Mountain Inn on July 16, 1988. Fox, who is Episcopalian, and Pollan, who is Jewish, had an interfaith ceremony with both a minister and rabbi. \"Michael seemed a little nervous,\" Rev. Joan O'Gorman later told People. \"In fact, they seemed just like any other young and loving couple who were excited to be getting married.\" Their first child, a son they named Sam Michael, was born on May 30, 1989. Fox and Pollan loved being parents, and would go on to have twin girls, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances, in 1995, and one more daughter, Esm\u00e9, in 2001. \"I kind of shut the door and said to everyone we love who wanted to see the baby, 'Just give us a little bit of time to get used to it ourselves,'\" Fox said after the birth of Sam. \"What's interesting is that the parental instinct just kicks in. The next thing you know, you've got a sore hip because you're holding him all the time.\" The couple grew even closer when faced with one of life\u2019s biggest challenges \u2013 Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 29 in 1991 (though it wasn\u2019t until 1998 that he shared the news publicly). \"A lot of my adjustment has been dictated by Michael's point of view,\" Pollan said in a 2002 interview with Oprah Winfrey. \"He's so relaxed and so accepting of where he is, and that makes it easier for me, the kids, and everyone around him.\" But when the couple first received the news, it completely shocked and devastated them. Fox fell into a depression and started drinking heavily, before eventually getting a handle on his new reality. \"I used to drink to party,\" the actor recalled on The Howard Stern Show in 2013, \"but...now I was drinking alone and to just not be [present]. Every day.\" \"So once I did that,\" he continued, \"then there was about a year of, like, a knife fight in a closet, where I just didn't have my tools to deal with it.

Heaven forbid.One of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.We liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.RELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to warMost importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years \u2014 particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.None of this is secret. It\u2019s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. \u201cI still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,\u201d Bolton said just last year.Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. \u201cIraq used to be no terrorists,\u201d Trump said in 2015. \u201c(N)ow it\u2019s the Harvard of terrorism.\u201d\u201cIf you look at Iraq from years ago, I\u2019m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,\u201d Trump said of Saddam Hussein, \u201cbut it was a lot better than it is right now.\u201dTrump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 \u201chelped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.\u201d In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.You can\u2019t learn from mistakes if you don\u2019t see mistakes.Trump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS \u2014 but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama \u201cfor his refusal to directly target Gaddafi\u201d and declared, \u201cthere is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi\u2026 But Obama missed it.\u201d In fact, Obama actually took Bolton\u2019s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, \u201cWe came, we saw, he died.\u201dWhen Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied \u201c100 percent.\u201d Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.No man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.All nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn\u2019t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, \u201cI hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.\u201dBolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself.

Did they bring down that Russian plane?OBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibilitySTEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility?OBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place.STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right?OBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage.And this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports.But this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened.STEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it?OBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit.What makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have.STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it meansOBAMA: with respect to ISIL.STEPHANOPOULOS: that Vladimir Putin will start to take them on?OBAMA: Well Putin, I think, from the start has been sincere in seeing ISIL as a threat. The reason he went into Syria is not primarily because of ISIL, but to prop up Assad. And part of our goal is to underscore for him and for everyone in the region that ISIL is the primary threat and you can't solve the ISIL problem if, in fact, you've got a country that is governed by somebody who's illegitimate and that the majority of Syrians reject.STEPHANOPOULOS: Big meeting this weekend.

The administration suggested that it might adjust its proposal, initially restricted to purchasing assets from financial institutions based in the United States, to enable foreign firms with United States affiliates to make use of it as well.The ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street, at least temporarily, into the obligations of American taxpayers was first put forward by the administration late last week after a series of bold interventions on behalf of ailing private firms seemed unlikely to prevent a crash of world financial markets.A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related assets would roughly be what the country has spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagon\u2019s total yearly budget appropriation. Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.Whatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year.

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"The report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine.

We know that he pledged allegiance to ISIS, that they are now taking credit and that part of their strategy is to radicalize individuals and encourage attacks against the United States, even if they are not coordinated with ISIS leadership.

In the days ahead, we will also learn more about the many lives he viciously cut short, many of them young people, just starting out in their lives. They were travel agents and pharmacy techs, college students and amusement park workers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and they had one thing in common. They all had a lot more to give.CLINTON: We should take a moment today amid our busy lives to think about them, to pray for everyone who was killed, for the wounded, those who are fighting to regain their lives and futures, for our first responders who walked into danger one more time.

So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav \u2014 real name, William Drayton \u2014 contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts \u201cto minimize his role in the Public Enemy business\u201d over the years, while managers continued to exploit \u201chis fame and persona to market the brand.\u201d  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group\u2019s business manager since 2008, and Clifton \u201cGreg\u201d Johnson, who was until recently Flav\u2019s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy\u2019s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo \u201centered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.\u201d Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, \u201cNothing is Quick in the Desert,\u201d available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  \u201cDrayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,\u201d the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  \u201cHe had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,\u201d the suit states.

So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:\u2022 In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.\u2022 The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn\u2019t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.\u2022 After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn\u2019t exist at the time).\u2022 He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.\u2022 The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.\"He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,\" Weaver said. \"He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.\"In April 1991, Sanders\u2019 then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.\"Bernie\u2019s response is that he doesn\u2019t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,\" Pollina said. \"It\u2019s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.\"The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders\u2019 own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.\"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,\" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents\u2019 preferences so does ", 0], ["Rihanna's style is one that we could only dream of emulating.

Jenelle Evans\u2019 past has been notoriously sketchy but the MTV Teen Mom 2 star says that despite the fact she has gotten her life back on track and that she\u2019s \u201cnot a bad kid any more\u201d, online speculation over her parenting methods is forcing Child Protection Services on her.  It comes after fans accused the star of child abuse after her son, Kaiser, begged for food on the TV show. The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.  In her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin \u201cfour or five times a day\u201d.  \u201cI was hooked,\u201d she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.  This week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,\u201d the reality star, 26, said.  Daughter Ensley did not test positive.  Ms Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.  \u201cI said, \u2018I did within the past 30 days,\u2019\u201d she explained.  \u201cI said, \u2018I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can\u2019t eat.\u2019 And they said, \u2018OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.\u2019\u201d  She said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.  But then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out \u201chaters online saying that I abuse my kids\u201d.  Despite promising she\u2019s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren\u2019t so sure.  All jokes aside, someone should go to the land and make sure that those kids (more so Kaiser) are in a safe situation. They do not deserve to be witnessing what\u2019s more than likely going on in their home.. #SaveKaiser #TeenMom2 #TeenMomOG #JenelleEvans #DavidEason \u2014 leeeasha (@leashaboo89) February 21, 2018  \u201cFirst of all, if I were on drugs I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit here in the morning and get the kids ready and eat healthily. Or I\u2019d be losing a lot of weight,\u201d Ms Evans said.  But the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.  \u201cI was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,\u201d she told Us Weekly last year,  \u201cI basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.  \u201cI really was so close to dying.\u201d  After her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as \u201cworst flu I\u2019ve ever had for seven days\u201d.  But by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was \u201cdisowned\u201d by family and friends.  \u201cIt hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn\u2019t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,\u201d she wrote in her memoir.  \u201cThe drugs always made the pain go away. They didn\u2019t turn on me or betray me. I guess heroin was my first steady, dependable lover. It gave me what I needed to live and I gave it my life. By this entry, heroin was the only thing I had in my life that loved me.\u201d  According to Kidspot, a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that the rate of pregnant women using marijuana has increased 62 per cent  Marijuana is the \u201cmost widely used illicit drug among all pregnant women\u201d, the ", 0], ["The 'Star Trek' icon denies a claim by Scott R. Brunton, who says he was groped at the actor's Los Angeles condo. A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable. \"This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,\" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. \"It is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up. I have been telling it for years, but I am suddenly very nervous telling it.\" Brunton says he was living in Hollywood in 1981, working as a waiter and beginning a career as a commercial actor and model when he met a 43- or 44-year-old Takei one evening at Greg's Blue Dot bar. The men exchanged numbers and would call one another from time to time as well as run into each other at clubs, Brunton says. When Brunton broke up with his then-boyfriend, he spoke with Takei. \"He said, 'Let me know what your new number is' and I did. And not long after we broke up and I moved out, George called me,\" Brunton recalls. Takei, as Brunton tells it, invited him to dinner and the theater. \"He was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,\" Brunton says. \"He was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve.\" The two men went back to the actor's condo for a drink the same night. \"We have the drink and he asks if I would like another,\" Brunton recalls. \"And I said sure. So, I have the second one, and then all of a sudden, I begin feeling very disoriented and dizzy, and I thought I was going to pass out. I said I need to sit down and he said sit over here and he had the giant yellow beanbag chair. So I sat down in that and leaned my head back and I must have passed out.\" \"The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,\" Brunton says. \"I came to and said, 'What are you doing?!' I said, 'I don't want to do this.' He goes, 'You need to relax. I am just trying to make you comfortable. Get comfortable.' And I said, 'No. I don't want to do this.' And I pushed him off and he said, 'OK, fine.' And I said I am going to go and he said, 'If you feel you must. You're in no condition to drive.' I said, 'I don't care I want to go.' So I managed to get my pants up and compose myself and I was just shocked. I walked out and went to my car until I felt well enough to drive home, and that was that.\" THR spoke to four longtime friends of Brunton \u2014 Norah Roadman, Rob Donovan, Stephen Blackshear and Jan Steward \u2014 who said that he had confided in them about the Takei encounter years ago. Takei's rep, Julia Buchwald, told THR, \"George is traveling in Japan and Australia and not reachable for comment.\" Takei, now 80, rose to fame playing Hikaru Sulu on the original Star Trek television series. He is also an author and activist and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights. In a series of tweets and in a Facebook post Saturday morning, Takei denied the allegations. \"The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do,\" he said. \"Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.\" Brunton claims that he met up with Takei years after the incident in Portland, Brunton's current home, while the actor was there on a book tour. \"I wanted to see him,\" Brunt", 0], ["\"Access denied | www.webmd.com used Cloudflare to restrict access\" this website is using security service to protect itself from online attacks ..

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is with us this afternoon, but I assure you, parents, there will be no cursing.I'm Jake Tapper, and this is THE LEAD.The national lead. An NRA task force lays out ideas to put a good guy with a gun in every school. I will ask Mayor Emanuel how that is going to apply in Chicago, which buries hundreds of people from gun violence every year.Also in national news, cheating on standardized tests, but not by students, by the school officials responsible for administering them. Now they're getting the ultimate detention in a jail cell.And the money lead. If there was a traffic sign that represented the auto industry just a few years ago, it would be rough road ahead. Did it take a little Italian carmaker to help turn -- Chrysler turn the corner?The national lead. It is an idea that could lead to kindergarten teachers carrying Glocks, principals spending their extracurricular time at target ranges.Today, a task force commission by the National Rifle Association unveiled a report with recommendations to make schools safer. The most controversial idea would put more guns in our nation's schools. The task force backed off the notion of putting armed volunteers in schools, but it wants to see more teachers and administrators trained and armed.Former Republican Congressman Asa Hutchinson is leading the task force and urging action on its recommendations.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ASA HUTCHINSON, FORMER UNDERSECRETARY FOR HOMELAND SECURITY: If you are interested in making our schools safer and to save children's lives, look at these recommendations seriously.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: We have seen so many Newtown parents advocating for gun control after 20 children were killed in a senseless massacre in December. But today we saw a Newtown parent standing with the NRA's task force.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK MATTIOLI, FATHER OF NEWTOWN VICTIM: I think politics need to sort of be set aside here. And I hope this doesn't lead to name calling, but rather this is recommendations for solutions, real solutions that will make our kids safer.(END VIDEO CLIP)TAPPER: If there is a city that sees the toll of gun violence every single day, it's Chicago, more than 500 homicides last year and almost 90 percent of them were gun-related. And yet Chicago has some of the most strict gun control laws in the nation.And Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel joins me now.Mr. Mayor, thanks for joining us.One of the recommendations issued today was that more individuals, more adults in schools become proficient in guns. I'm wondering your reaction to that.RAHM EMANUEL (D), MAYOR OF CHICAGO: No, look, I think that is not what schools are for and that's not where you want the time and training for principals and teachers. You want that on the education of our children. There's a whole host of things to do different as it relates to safety in schools, but training principals and teachers on use of handguns is not one of them.TAPPER: A lot of people look to the city of Chicago and they say, here's a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. And although crime and homicide has gone down this year, it still has a staggeringly high homicide rate.How do you reconcile that?EMANUEL: Well, Jake, first of all, as you know, March, our homicides dropped nearly 70 percent; in February, it dropped 50 percent. And in the first three months are down a total of 50 homicides, 42 percent. So it's a very significant drop and one of the most -- March was one of the biggest one-month drops in the history of the city of Chicago.Second is, it's, you know, people in the city of Chicago, t", 0], ["\"Alcohol and Substance Use (COVID-19)\" increased stress can lead to increases in alcohol and substance use. if you or someone you care about is starting to use alcohol or other substances or is increasing their use during the covid-19 pandemic here are a few suggestions that may help medication assisted treatment for alcohol or opioid use disorders may be an option. take medicine as prescribed and continue your therapy treatment or support appointments in person or through telehealth services when possible. call the nati.

And ever since, nearly every President and Congress, whether Democrat or Republican, has attempted to meet this challenge in some way. A bill for comprehensive health reform was first introduced by John Dingell Sr. in 1943. Sixty-five years later, his son continues to introduce that same bill at the beginning of each session.Our collective failure to meet this challenge \u2013 year after year, decade after decade \u2013 has led us to a breaking point. Everyone understands the extraordinary hardships that are placed on the uninsured, who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans. Some can't get insurance on the job. Others are self-employed, and can't afford it, since buying insurance on your own costs you three times as much as the coverage you get from your employer. Many other Americans who are willing and able to pay are still denied insurance due to previous illnesses or conditions that insurance companies decide are too risky or expensive to cover.We are the only advanced democracy on Earth \u2013 the only wealthy nation \u2013 that allows such hardships for millions of its people. There are now more than thirty million American citizens who cannot get coverage. In just a two year period, one in every three Americans goes without health care coverage at some point. And every day, 14,000 Americans lose their coverage. In other words, it can happen to anyone.But the problem that plagues the health care system is not just a problem of the uninsured. Those who do have insurance have never had less security and stability than they do today. More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose your health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care. It happens every day.One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because his insurer found that he hadn't reported gallstones that he didn't even know about. They delayed his treatment, and he died because of it. Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne. By the time she had her insurance reinstated, her breast cancer more than doubled in size. That is heart-breaking, it is wrong, and no one should be treated that way in the United States of America.Then there's the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren't any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It's why so many employers \u2013 especially small businesses \u2013 are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance, or are dropping their coverage entirely. It's why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first place, and why American businesses that compete internationally \u2013 like our automakers \u2013 are at a huge disadvantage. And it's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it \u2013 about $1000 per year that pays for somebody else's emergency room and charitable care.Finally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When health care costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close.Advertisement Continue rea", 0], ["\"Access denied | www.webmd.com used Cloudflare to restrict access\" this website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks ..

NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt moderated the debate at Hofstra University in New York. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump went head-to-head for the first time Monday night in a debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. The debate was moderated by Lester Holt of NBC News and came as polls both nationally and in swing states are increasingly tight.The complete transcript of the debate is posted below.

Post staff annotations will appear by default; others are in a menu that you can see in the upper right when you click or tap on an annotation.LESTER HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: How are you, Donald?(APPLAUSE)HOLT: Good luck to you.(APPLAUSE)Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin.We're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?CLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, an", 0], ["Alicia Vikander has never been happier since tying the knot with Michael Fassbender!

Fans have been hoping these two would part ways pretty much from the day they went public with their relationship, and now that Amber has a new boyfriend, it seems it's safe to say she and Matt are well and truly over.  But while TMOG viewers may be thrilled by the split, Matt is most definitely not.  The newly single Baier opened up about his split from Amber in a recent interview with E! News:  \"I'm trying to do a lot of work on myself because I realize now the downfall of our relationship was my fault,\" he explained.  \"When you're thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.\"  Baier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren't on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:  \"What I've learned from this is you have to do the work,\" he told the outlet.  \"You have to make the person you're with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I'm paying the price.\"  Matt says he's full of regrets over the way his relationship played out, and if given a second chance, he would change everything about the way he behaved.  \"If I got a do-over,\" he said, \"I would do everything differently. I should have listened to her more.\"  The couple was filming a new season of the We TV reality series Marriage Boot Camp at the time of their split.  Matt left the set ahead of schedule and took off for Vegas - where he's apparently been living ever since.  \"I went to Vegas to get my head around the split. Ultimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues. Obviously, that didn't happen.\"  But despite the fact that Amber is in a new relationship, Matt is still hopeful that she'll find her way back to him:  \"I'll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends,\" Baier says.  \"We started off as best friends and that's what I miss the most from her\u2014her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.\"  As though that's not depressing enough, Baier concluded the info with some insights into his day-to-day life post-Amber:  \"I've been making a living through my [poker] winnings,\" he says.  \"That said, I'm not really enjoying it. This isn't the life I want to live.\"  Yeesh. Matt may not have been the perfect boyfriend, but here's hoping he's able to pull himself out of what sounds like a pretty considerable funk.

We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time. We\u2019ve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don\u2019t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it\u2019s like it was only yesterday.

By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn\u2019t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week.

I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It\u2019s amazing, Hollywood\u2019s obsession with the aging of women.

It\u2019s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. \u0093I\u2019m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,\u0094 he says as he plows toward the ballroom.Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson\u2019s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman\u0097a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband\u2019s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly.

The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. \u0093People talk about the last election. They say, \u0091The war, the war, the war,\u2019\u0094 Thompson says with a sigh. \u0093I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it\u2019s understandable.

But the man can hit his mark. \u0093You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,\u0094 Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. \u0093Without raising a dime, I was in the pack.

In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film \u201cTrue Lies.\u201d According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he \u201claid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.\u201d Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he \u201cmethodically built my and my parents\u2019 trust, for months grooming me,\u201d and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel\u2019s pool.

(Republicans: \u201cThis President is breaking the law!\u201d Democrats: \u201cThey want to impeach the president!\u201d) And what\u2019s particularly jarring is that this isn\u2019t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s beneath the White House, and it\u2019s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren\u2019t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American\u2019s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that\u2019s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn\u2019t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that\u2019s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn\u2019t). In the case of the border, there just isn\u2019t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP\u2019s $659 million border bill, NBC\u2019s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are \u201ccautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a \u2018brick wall\u2019 in the House.\u201d Then again, it\u2019s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here\u2019s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: \u201cThe Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,\u201d Roll Call reports. \u201cAfter the Senate\u2019s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 \u2014 Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a \u2018free vote\u2026because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out \u2014 after they\u2019ve left\u2019 for the August recess.\u201d So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund \u201ccliff\u201d of sorts, the threat is back.

I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I\u2019ve perfected my own blowout skills. It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business. 1. You don\u2019t have a great blow-dryer. Let\u2019s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you\u2019re blow-drying your hair often. \u201cIf you have thick hair, you\u2019re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,\u201d K\u00e9rastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. \u201cThe technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,\u201d she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be. Yepez\u2019s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you\u2019ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon\u2014and they\u2019ll last you years. 2. You\u2019re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel. \u201cAfter getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,\u201d says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad\u2019s creative director. \u201cA cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,\u201d he explains. If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo. The best thing for your hair\u2019s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. \u201cHair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,\u201d explains Vaccaro. Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That\u2019s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it\u2019s still a little damp. If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it\u2019s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying. 3. You start in with the brush too soon. On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It\u2019s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. \u201cIf hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cThis can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.\u201d Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush. 4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head.

CLINTON: Well, this is a contested campaign. And as I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Obama, but we have differences. And in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that Senator Obama's campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on NAFTA have been very disturbing to me.And therefore, I think it's important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.You know, for example, it's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not. You know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine. It is something I believe in with all my heart. And every day that I'm campaigning, and certainly here throughout Ohio, I've met so many families -- happened again this morning in Lorain -- who are just devastated because they don't get the health care they deserve to have. And unfortunately it's a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and Senator Obama's plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable. And on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that.And Senator Obama's plan does not cover everyone. It would leave, give or take, 15 million people out. So we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone. That's my goal. That's what I'm fighting for, and I'm going to stand up for that.MR. WILLIAMS: On the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website The Drudge Report, showing Senator Obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas.Matt Drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the Clinton campaign. Can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not?Advertisement Continue reading the main storySEN. CLINTON: Well, so far as I know, it did not. And I certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that that's not the kind of behavior that I condone or expect from the people working in my campaign. But we have no evidence where it came from.So I think that it's clear what I would do if it were someone in my campaign, as I have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that I disagree with.MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, your response.SEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo. So I think that's something that we can set aside.I do want to focus on the issue of health care because Senator Clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate. Now, keep in mind that I have consistently said that Senator Clinton's got a good health care plan. I think I have a good health care plan. I think mine is better, but I have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.I have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from Senator Clinton in Iowa, in Nevada and other places suggesting that I want to leave 15 million people out.According to Senator Clinton, that is accurate. I dispute it, and I think it is inaccurate. On the other hand, I don't fault Senator Clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.The reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is because of a mandate.

I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October. Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis. It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments. Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss. The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me. They have not been shared or cleared with anyone. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain. (APPLAUSE) Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign. Quote, \"We must achieve both security and solvency. In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,\" end quote. With that in mind, the first lead question. Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan? First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country. You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me? How's it going to affect my job? How's it going to affect my house? How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money. Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns. Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes. And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down. It hasn't worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.LEHRER: Senator McCain, two minutes.MCCAIN: Well, thank you, Jim.

It\u2019s a ritual for many that\u2019s as beloved as that first sip of Peppermint Mocha. It\u2019s not easy to find the very first Starbucks holiday cups, which made their debut in stores in 1997. Few were saved, and electronic design files were lost in an earthquake in 2001. Even an Internet search is unyielding, with the cups having made their arrival long before the first selfie. Luckily, designer Sandy Nelson, a Starbucks alumna, stashed away a set of these cups, along with other artifacts from her 14 years working in Starbucks Creative Studio. She remembers the design fondly, one of her first assignments at Starbucks. \u201cIt was August, and I had just started with the company,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe were working on holiday creative for the season to come. We had what felt like a hundred cup designs pinned up on the wall. Then Howard [Schultz] came by, looked at all of them, and picked my design. I couldn\u2019t believe mine was chosen.\u201d That first cup wasn\u2019t really red \u2013 at least not the holiday red that Starbucks has become known for. It was closer to a magenta, and the cup also came in three more colors: sapphire, emerald and amethyst. The design featured swirls and hand-drawn holly leaves that were flecked with coffee beans. Download video for media use Nelson was in Anchorage visiting a friend when she saw the cups in a store for the first time. \u201cI remember seeing the cups piled high on the counter, and I realized \u2018this is big,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was thrilling.\u201d It would be two more years, in 1999, before the Starbucks cup would don its signature red color. Jon Cannell, manager Creative Design, was part of the design team that year. \u201cI remember it all started when the creative director asked us, \u2018What is holiday red? Is it burgundy? Is it more of a ruby color,'\u201d Cannell said. \u201cWe brought in all these holiday items in a range of reds, and we landed on a red that we all agreed on.\u201d That year, they settled on a vibrant shade of candy-apple red with whimsical drawings of snowflakes, stockings and other images that evoked the spirit of the holiday. \u201cThere was a response to that shade of red,\u201d Cannell said. \u201cIt was a joyous color, and it really resonated with customers.\u201d Over two decades, Starbucks holiday cups became emblematic of the holiday, with designs that reflect the joy of the season with scenes of celebration and gathering. That shade of red was the foundation for the cups, the canvas for each creation that has evolved over the years. The cup became a symbol of the holidays, the anticipation growing with each passing year. Over the years, online countdown clocks have sprung up as speculation builds on social media. It is now a fixture in popular culture, the star of both morning talk shows and late night stand-up routines. Passions for the cup have run so high that even the design could become controversial, as it did in 2015 when Starbucks introduced a modern two-toned, ombr\u00e9 red design. The 2017 design echoes themes from cups of years past with intimate moments connected by swirls of red and white. But this time the coloring book inspired design leaves room for customers to add their own color. \u201cWe\u2019re inviting everyone to color in the holidays in a way that\u2019s meaningful to them,\u201d said Leanne Fremar, executive creative director for Starbucks. Maybe even magenta. 1997 These first holiday cups were adorned with hand-drawn holly and swirls dotted with tiny coffee beans.

The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman\u2019s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The chorus? \u201cEverything is better on TV\u201d\u2014including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, \u201ctreason.\u201d Once he finally took the stage\u2014along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids\u2014Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn\u2019t take long to get to the Trump jokes: \u201cIf he had won an Emmy,\u201d Colbert quipped, \u201cI bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he\u2019s just Walter, much whiter.\u201d  \u201cUnlike the presidency,\u201d Colbert added, \u201cEmmys go to the winner of the popular vote.\u201d  Still, Colbert couldn\u2019t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.  Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala\u2019s crowd size: \u201cThis is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,\u201d Spicer said with a straight face. \u201cBoth in person and around the world.\u201d  \u201cWow,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cthat really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.\u201d  In the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.  Will the president respond?

Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton\u2019s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here\u2019s everything we know about Middleton\u2019s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton\u2019s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three \u2014 who gave birth to a second baby boy in April \u2014 is worth at least \u00a35 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as \u00a37.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton\u2019s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn\u2019t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton\u2019s net worth is a lot less than her prince \u2014 Wealth-X estimates Prince William\u2019s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William\u2019s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal \u2014 an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson\u2014Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton\u2019s money?  Most of Middleton\u2019s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around \u00a330 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least \u00a3250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew\u2019s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton\u2019s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth \u00a31 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson\u2014Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn\u2019t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family\u2019s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money \u2014 her net worth is believed to be about $5 million \u2014 as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.

Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story. While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel interviewed Bekah M., or Bekah Martinez, over a video call. After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm \u2014 the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm \u2014 Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story.  TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the \"Humboldt 35,\" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) \"First of all,\" she told Kimmel. \"A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show.\"  ABC/YouTube  According to the missing persons report, Martinez left for Northern California on Nov. 12, and her mother reported that she'd been missing on Nov. 18 after not heard from her daughter. Since The Bachelor began filming on Sept. 20, and now everyone knows that Martinez was eliminated after the seventh week, that means that she left the show sometime in early Nov. 2017. The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor.  After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two \u2014 or that she was the one Luyendyk picked.  But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. \"I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,\" she told Kimmel. \"I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing.\"  As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography. \"I was on a marijuana farm?\" she said before laughing and then explaining, \" It's Humboldt County.\" In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms. Her simple explanation makes sense, and she also clarified to Kimmel that she's still a nanny in Los Angeles and not a weed farmer.  Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination.

That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul\u2019s proposal a \u2018cut\u2019 for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul\u2019s budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise?\"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul\u2019s proposal a \"cut.\"\"Paul\u2019s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president\u2019s budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Paul\u2019s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\"Paul\u2019s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama\u2019s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul\u2019s budget a \"cut.\"\"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\"Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.\"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a \u2018cut\u2019 when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\"Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz\u2019s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul\u2019s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.\"This was a budget, so it d", 0], ["The second season of RuPaul's Drag Race premiered on February 1, 2010, and aired its final episode on April 26, 2010.

Reporting from ABC News Headquarters, George Stephanopoulos.STEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper. We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet.And our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Greenwald. You are really on a roll. You broke another story yesterday showing the scale of the data collection programs. In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here?GREENWALD: There are two key findings. One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power. These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate.So what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist. And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically.STEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies. Your response to that?GREENWALD: Every single time any major media outlet reports on something that the government is hiding, that political officials don't want people to know, such as the fact that they are collecting the phone records of all Americans, regardless of any suspicion of wrongdoing? The people in power do exactly the same thing.

More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish \"rights\" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are \"an earned right.\" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.There has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled \"RESERVATION OF POWER,\" specifically said: \"The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress.\" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits. Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party. Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated. He appealed the termination arguing, among other claims, that promised Social Security benefits were a contract and that Congress could not renege on that contract. In its ruling, the Court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to Social Security benefits is not contractual right. Flemming V. Nestor Case Name: FLEMMING V. NESTOR 363 U.S. 603 NO. 54. ARGUED FEBRUARY 24, 1960. - DECIDED JUNE 20, 1960. - 169 F. SUPP. 922, REVERSED .

Streaming services and devices  Cord-cutters who still want to watch the Golden Globes live, whether it\u2019s for the acceptance speeches or gags, can catch the awards ceremony through several streaming services and devices, including Sling TV, Hulu Live TV, DirecTV Now, YouTube TV, Century Link Stream and Fubo TV in markets where local channels like NBC are offered.

He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.While watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. \"I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,\" Obama said. \"But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.\"We checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.Obama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would \"strongly support\" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.We searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the \"process moving this first year.\" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated \"that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\"Alas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework \"to fix our broken immigration system.\" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a \"a very important step.\"Finally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. \"In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we\"ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,\" said Obama.Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills.

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico\u2019s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.\"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\"The report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEA\u2019s term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\"The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman.

Apatow made his documentary directorial debut with the 2016 Emmy Award-nominated ESPN Films 30 for 30 feature, Doc & Darryl, which chronicled the successes and scandals of New York Mets legends Dwight \u201cDoc\u201d Gooden and Darryl Strawberry. He followed that up with the forthcoming co-directed HBO documentary, May It Last, about folk rock icons the Avett Brothers premiering on HBO later this month.  Continuing down the documentarian path, Apatow is in post-production on a documentary on Garry Shandling who served as Judd\u2019s mentor and father figure. The two-part documentary will air over two nights in late March on HBO.  Additionally, Apatow currently serves as co-executive producer of the television series Crashing, which returns to HBO for its second season in January 2018. He is also the co-executive producer of Netflix\u2019s Love which returns for its third season in March 2018. Lastly, Apatow co-executive produced the multi-award-winning HBO series Girls which wrapped its final season earlier this year.  On the film side, Apatow recently produced the 2017 romantic comedy, The Big Sick, starring Kumail Nanjiani, Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. The dark horse box office success earned a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes which was the highest rated film of the summer.  Apatow has written and directed such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Trainwreck. He has also produced Superbad, Bridesmaids, Pineapple Express, and both Anchorman films, to name but a few.  Apatow has been a DGA member for two decades.

Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump \u2018is ISIS\u2019s greatest triumph\u2019]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & \"concentration camps\" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui \u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.\u201cYesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,\u201d Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: \u201cThe West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.\u201dThe al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real.

The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It\u2019s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.PhotoI didn\u2019t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone \u2014 not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 \u2014 shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what\u2019s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion \u2014 a staggering $227.4 million on average \u2014 but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest.

No - Dr. Phil was involved in a traffic accident. And the skateboarder he hit might be in for a serious payday. But ... it's complicated.  With the possible exception of a few midwestern grandmas, we don't think that anyone actually thinks that Dr. Phil is infallible.  ... Or the sort of expert to whom you should be listening about the most important things in your life, honestly.  He's just a guy whom some people find charming and folksy and he makes for good television.  Like, one of the statements from his show that's highlighted on his Instagram page is \"Parenting is both a noun and a verb.\"  ... Yes.  That is literally how language works. (When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious. Also, never tell the other person \"sorry,\" even if you do feel sorry, as that can be used against you as an admission of fault)  Terrence Bembury now paints a different picture, posting about being injured.  Right now, we don't know whether he was genuinely injured or whether he suddenly realized that he'd have to be out of his mind to not get any cash out of Dr. Phil.  While Terrence might not benefit from the multiple versions of events, as police say that he had earlier been singing the same tune as Dr. Phil and only later changed his story, he says that he's securing a lawyer.  And, honestly, police have reviewed traffic footage and say that Dr. Phil was in the wrong.  If Terrance was actually injured, it sounds like he might have a real case.  We have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, if Terrance was injured in the slightest, you'd think that Dr. Phil would be culpable for it.  On the other hand, we've never understood why skateboarders (or bicycles!) are allowed on streets. If we have to humor people who insist upon riding that awful middle-ground between walking and cars, maybe they should have their own lanes, right?  And then there's the possibility -- though we're not accusing him of anything -- that Terrence is taking advantage of this situation for cash.  But ... we think that most people would, right?  Terrence certainly didn't seek out this situation (no one has accused Terrence of being a mastermind schemer who somehow arranged for this to happen or anything), and it's hard to blame him for trying to make the best out of a bad situation.  Dr. Phil might feel differently, though.  But do you know what's the weirdest about this case?  With all of his money, it sounds like Dr. Phil drives himself home from work.", 0], ["After three years of ups and downs, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon are finally officially together \u2014 and sharing all the details of their emotional love story.
