[["News in Brief\nIn the Nation\nSame-sex marriage bill advances in California\nThe California Senate approved legislation yesterday that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The 21-15 vote sets the stage for a vote next week in the Assembly, which narrowly rejected similar legislation in June. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblyman Mark Leno, said he expected a vote in the Assembly on Tuesday. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's office had no comment on how he would respond if the bill reached his desk, spokeswoman Margita Thompson said. Massachusetts became the first state to recognize gay marriages when a state court legalized same-sex weddings there in 2003. - AP\nEducation Dept. allows\nChicago to tutor students\nFederal education officials are bending the rules to let Chicago tutor struggling students despite the district's failure to meet federal standards, Education Secretary Margaret Spellings announced yesterday. She said that the district was getting a waiver because it has shown improvement. She also said the move is an example of her flexibility in enforcing the law. The Chicago action is a one-year pilot program. An Education Department fact sheet said other urban districts will be added \"in the near future,\" but did not name those districts. - AP\nFBI ends tests matching bullets by lead content\nThe FBI decided yesterday to stop tests that match bullets by lead content, a practice criticized as producing a high rate of false matches between crime-scene bullets and bullets taken from suspects. The bureau said it was informing about 300 state and local law-enforcement agencies that had received positive match reports from the FBI since 1966. The FBI said it had not determined that those results were in error but was advising those agencies so they could take whatever action they deem appropriate. Criminal defense attorneys have contended that re-evaluation of the usefulness of these tests could affect some convictions on appeal. - AP\n", ["Political", "Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction", "Policy Prescription and Evaluation"]], ["Lily Tomlin got married.

But between the National Rifle Association's refusal to engage in reasonable debate, and the hurry of gun control advocates to act while they can, I'm afraid we will get new laws that do little to prevent future shootings. A ban on new assault rifles will make many people feel better, but will do nothing about the millions of assault rifles already out there. And, the availability of these weapons may not be the most important reason we're seeing so many shootings, so often.\nI believe the epidemic of mass shootings is caused by a \"copycat\" effect, driven by intense and detailed media coverage. Social psychologists have already identified a copycat effect in suicides. Well-publicized suicides are usually followed by an increase in suicide by people who are similar to the well-publicized case.

When one ignited a new lawsuit against the giant tobacco industry, the others would gather around, hoping the spark would flare into a flame.  Some industry analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the mighty cigarette companies fail to defend themselves successfully.  Lawyers representing about 80 plaintiffs with pending tobacco liability lawsuits - alleging everything from an industrywide conspiracy to false advertising - are focusing now on a small Belleville courtroom. Each hopes that attorney Bruce Cook can chisel away enough of the industry's seemingly impenetrable armor to expose a weak spot.  Whenever one of these lawyers gets a case before a jury, the others watch the fray. If something useful pops out of the mountains of paperwork, they will follow the new trail. \"Nobody has come up with a smoking gun in tobacco litigation yet,\" according to Nick Sullivan, tobacco editor of Tobacco Industry Litigation Reporter, a newsletter about lawsuits affecting the industry.  \"I don't know that anyone will. It's a long and difficult process to want to take one of these to court,\" he said.  For years, lawyers have tried to prove that cigarettes were a defective product. They argued that the health problems associated with smoking cigarettes were known to the industry and that it nevertheless continued to use false and misleading advertising to get people to smoke.  However, warning labels carried on cigarette packs since 1966 have insulated the tobacco companies thus far, eroding sympathy from juries. Judging from past cases, jurors apparently believe that a person who chooses to smoke also chooses to risk health problems associated with smoking.  Plaintiff's lawyers have complained that the smoking industry has leveraged them into economic submission, forcing them to drop potentially strong cases because of the costs associated with the lengthy lawsuits.  \"They drag it on and on,\" Sullivan lamented.  Every plaintiff since 1954 - when Missourian John Ross sued a cigarette company for making a product that allegedly caused his larynx cancer - has failed to prove cigarettes are responsible for their cancer, or that the tobacco industry intentionally misled them about the dangers of smoking.  A federal court jury in 1962 - made up of 12 smokers - determined that Ross' lawyers did not prove that cigarettes caused cancer and gave the industry its first of a 30-year string of wins.  Lawyers for Shook, Hardy & Bacon, a Kansas City law firm that has defended the tobacco companies in liability lawsuits since the Ross case, set the standard for how tobacco companies would defend themselves: yielding no quarter, fighting over every detail.  According to one New Jersey lawyer who fought the tobacco companies for nearly a decade on a single case, no one has ever definitively proven - at least, not to a jury's satisfaction - that smoking is harmful to human health.  \"Their's is a war of attrition,\" said lawyer Marc Edell, who made history in 1988 when a jury decided that a tobacco company, Liggett Group Inc., had to pay damages in a case he had handled.  \"Pretty soon there won't be a group of people able to sue the tobacco companies, because they'll have either quit smoking or died,\" he said.  Lawyers across the country got out their contingency fee calculators when the New Jersey federal court jury ordered Liggett Group Inc. to pay Cipollone's husband, Antonio, $400,000. It was the nation's first monetary damage award against the industry. But the jury absolved Philip Morris Inc.  and Lorillard Inc., which made other brands of cigarettes that Rose Cipollone had smoked.  Edell was confident that the tobacco companies would be vulnerable under a law that says if a product's risks outweigh its benefits, and someone gets hurt by the product, then the injured party can sue and win.  The jury agreed with that logic. An appeals court didn't and ordered the verdict reversed, because of an error in the jury instructions. Edell had never proven that Cipollone either saw or believed cigarette advertisements before 1966.  The appellate court also ruled that plaintiffs could not sue for claims that occurred after Jan. 1, 1966, when federal law mandated warning labels on cigarette packages.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark decision handed down June 25, disagreed. The High Court determined that the federal law requiring warning labels did not pre-empt lawsuits, but rather narrowed the scope of those lawsuits to a theory of concealment.  That is, the industry has hid behind the labels for year, noting that smokers before 1966 continued to smoke of their own free will, disregarding the package warnings. However, the industry has steadfastly refused to validate those warnings by agreeing that they have been proven scientifically.  \"The tobacco industry welcomed the warning label,\" Edell said in a telephone interview. \"It was not an admission on their part that the product was harmful.\" Edell said that the landmark Cipollone case has done 80 percent of the work in the attempt to find a way to beat the tobacco companies in court. The rest of the job is up to the plaintiffs' lawyers.  Edell said the law firm for which he works is expected to drop its representation on all tobacco cases. After the Supreme Court ruling in Cipollone, which remanded the case for retrial, Edell and Cipollone's family decided it was just too expensive to continue.  That withdrawal has put Cook and his client, Charles Kueper, 51, in the spotlight. Cook is chasing the conspiracy theory with a vengeance. Edell thinks Cook may win.  \"It takes running into a brick wall a few times before it breaks down.\"\n", ["Health and Safety", "Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction"]], ["The City Hall Superhero, on Gay Marriage\nThe mayor of New York City comes out in support of gay marriage and political fallout ensues.

Barney Frank: As a well intentioned mistake. What we have in Boston is a binding marriage procedure underway. People in Massachusetts will be married in a few months. What is happening in San Francisco is a form of protest which unfortunately will almost certainly not lead to legally recognized marriages and damage the cause of same sex marriage politically in two ways. First, in Massachusetts we have had some people threatening various forms of obstruction of the supreme court?s order to require legal marriage. We have responded by insisting people follow the law -- particularly public officials. We do this because we think that once we have actual marriages legally binding the experience will be the best representation of the same sex arguments. In San Francisco we effectively have people who are saying that we are going to be changing the law by redefining it and that goes counter to our argument. Secondly, it is very important that we defeat George Bush's constitutional amendment to ban same sex marriage. To the extent that people from all over the country are going to San Francisco and then returning to their home states saying they are now legally married that generates political support in other states for the constitutional amendment with no gain because they will not be considered legally married in those states. So I believe the best way to get to same sex marriage is to make sure we can implement it in Massachusetts, block the federal effort to cancel this out and then give the country an example for a couple of years that same sex marriage have zero negative effects on anyone else.\n", ["Political", "Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction"]], ["White House Plan on Immigration Includes Legal Status\nThe Obama administration will insist on measures to give legal status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants as it pushes early next year for legislation to overhaul the immigration system, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Friday.\nIn her first major speech on the overhaul, Ms. Napolitano dispelled any suggestion that the administration -- with health care, energy and other major issues crowding its agenda -- would postpone the most contentious piece of immigration legislation until after midterm elections next November.\nLaying out the administration's bottom line, Ms. Napolitano said officials would argue for a ''three-legged stool'' that includes tougher enforcement laws against illegal immigrants and employers who hire them and a streamlined system for legal immigration, as well as a ''tough and fair pathway to earned legal status.''\nWith unemployment surging over 10 percent and Congress still wrangling over health care, advocates on all sides of the immigration debate had begun to doubt that President Obama would keep his pledge to tackle the divisive illegal immigration issue in the first months of 2010.\nSpeaking at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group in Washington, Ms. Napolitano unveiled a double-barrel argument for a legalization program, saying it would enhance national security and, as the economy climbs out of recession, protect American workers from unfair competition from lower-paid, easily exploited illegal immigrants.\n", ["Policy Presecription and Evaluation", "Economic", "Political", "Policy Prescription and Evaluation"]], ["WALK FOR SANITY\nFear drives bridge rally\nCity parents join kids after wave of school shootings\nKIDS AND adults used their feet to voice the desperate need for gun control.\nLed by the NY-based group Youth Over Guns, students, adults, community leaders, survivors and stars including Susan Sarandon and Julianne Moore marched across the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday to call for and end to gun violence.\nMore than 700 participants, dressed in orange shirts turned the majestic span into a pumpkin-colored walkway.\nIt is a color of solidarity, traditionally used to evoke safety, but it took on another dimension as many of the posters hefted some kind of reference to President Trump, who has sometimes been mocked as for his orange complexion.\nMarchers carried signs that read \"Vote them out\" and \"slay the NRA\" and \"Arms are for hugging.\" Other marchers car-ried a white casket.\nIn addition to addressing the issue of gun violence in schools, the march, which began at noon at the Korean War Veter-ans Memorial in Brooklyn and ended in Foley Square in Manhattan was designed to shed light on gun violence in communities of color.\nSamantha Rodriguez, 14, from Harlem, said, \"A lot of people keep getting shot.

The most heinous of the industry's efforts is the use of a marketing tool called \"Old Joe Camel,\" who portrays cigarette smoking as a \"cool thing to do.\" The AMA and Novello want to encourage students to help stop tobacco use among their peers by fighting back. They are asking students in kindergarten through eighth grade to draw a poster or write a letter, poem or essay, one page or less, telling \"Old Joe Camel\" why he should stop smoking. We hope that teachers will use it as a springboard to discuss the dangers of smoking with their students.  Winners will be chosen in three categories - grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8.

I followed the instructions precisely and the wart gradually became smaller and smaller as I continued the banana treatment. It took several days, but the wart finally disappeared.

Now, new research is complicating the picture further, suggesting that big shifts are already under way in how forests work.\nA paper published Wednesday suggests that trees in at least some parts of the world are having to pull less water out of the ground to achieve a given amount of growth. Some scientists say they believe that this may be a direct response to the rising level of carbon dioxide in the air from human emissions, though that has not yet been proved.\nIf the research holds up, it suggests some potential benefits for forests. They might be able to make do with less water, for instance, becoming more resilient in the face of drought and higher temperatures as climate change proceeds.\nBut the new finding also has potential downsides, scientists said. The immense volume of water that trees pull out of the ground winds up in the atmosphere, helping supply moisture to farming areas downwind of forests. So if trees use less water, that could ultimately mean less rain for thirsty crops in at least some regions of the world.\nSeveral scientists predicted that the new research would set off a flurry of efforts to clarify whether trees are really using less, and what the implications might be, not only for forests but for the human and ecological systems that depend on existing patterns of moisture flow.\n", ["Capacity and Resources primany", "Capacity and Resources"]], ["Poll says voters in N.J. support gay marriage\nA majority of likely voters in New Jersey say that gay and lesbian couples should be able to marry, a poll released yesterday indicated.\nBy a 14 percent margin (55 to 41 percent), 803 adults surveyed by Zogby International said that same-sex marriage should be legalized.

Gay marriage is already legal in six states and the District.\nBut success in those states came only because of actions by legislatures or judges. The victory in Maryland - together with a similar one on the same day in Maine - shows for the first time in America that the public as a whole can side with the principle of equality rather than channel the reflexive, anti-gay prejudice that still lingers in our society.\n(Same-sex marriage was also on the ballot in Washington state, where the result wasn't available at deadline for this edition.)\nMarriage triumphed in Maryland partly because activists from the start openly stressed the powerful appeal of equal, civil rights, especially to African American voters. They did so more than earlier campaigns have done in other states.\nThat approach won over Beverly Clough, 62, of Prince George's County.

But since only 19 percent of U.S. women die between the ages of 35 and 69, the share of those deaths in which smoking can be blamed is 37 percent -- the highest proportion for women of any country in the Lancet study.\n", ["Health and Safety", "Cultural Identity"]], ["MAN TAKING DRUG AT SENTENCING WINS A NEW MURDER TRIAL\nA Mason County man who asked to be executed for killing a woman won a new trial this week because of doubts over his state of mind when he pleaded guilty.\nIn a 4-3 ruling made public Thursday, the state Supreme Court found reason to doubt Scotty Lee Kinkead's judgment because he was taking the prescribed psychotropic drug Thorazine at the time of his plea and sentencing hearing.\nKinkead had accepted a plea agreement that would have spared him the death penalty for the robbery-murder of Gertrude Nussell, 85, in 1992.

Carbon dioxide traps solar energy and raises global temperatures.\nBut scientists have recently discovered that methane, commonly produced by fermenting vegetation, also contributes strongly to climatic warming. A large share of the methane released into the atmosphere comes from the chemical degradation of cellulose in the guts of termites, rodents, ungulates and other eaters of wood and straw.\nThe methane molecule, consisting of one atom of carbon and four of hydrogen, is produced in environments where no oxygen is available, as in the rumens of cattle. The rumen is a separate compartment of a cow's stomach, where cellulose is broken down by symbiotic bacteria into digestible cud and methane gas.\nThe production of methane in the rumen can be greatly reduced by feeding cattle substances called ionophores, which Dr. Johnson described as ''weak, selective antibiotics.'' These substances, already widely used in the feeding of beef cattle, selectively inhibit the reproduction of methane-producing bacteria in the gut, leaving room for other bacteria that help digestion more efficiently.\nIonophores are not ordinarily used with dairy and other cattle, however. Dr. Johnson believes that other possibilities for reducing methane production should be developed.\n", ["Capacity and Resources primany", "Capacity and Resources"]], ["Gays make 102-story statement\nThe Empire State Building will go lavender for three days.\nThe skyscraper will be doused in lavender light June 22-24 for the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride March.

That principle, basic to our concept of liberty, applies to I.N.S. officials as well as to the police.\nIndeed, a Federal court in New York held unconstitutional the I.N.S. practice of mass detentions of large numbers of suspected aliens absent reasonable suspicion that each and every person so detained is an alien illegally present in the United States. The I.N.S. position vis-a-vis the Iranian demonstrators stands in stark contradiction to these judicial precedents.\nIt is a measure of the strength of our society that we can tolerate the exercise of free speech and assembly even by those whose motivations may be questioned and with whom we may most vigorously disagree.

Actually, she told the Court of Criminal Appeals, she meant to say ''ammunition.''\nDefense lawyers also said other new information cast doubt on the guilt of Ms. Newton, who would be the third woman put to death in Texas since capital punishment resumed in 1982 and the first black woman executed in the state since the Civil War.\nThis included, they said, a sworn account from a relative of Ms. Newton's who had been incarcerated in the Harris County jail in 1987 and 1988 and told of a cellmate who had boasted of going to the Newtons' house the night of the slayings to collect a drug debt ''with orders to kill everybody present if the man did not have the money.''\n", ["Cultural Identity", "Fairness and Equality", "Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction", "Crime and Punishment"]], ["Ciao to All That\nIn Italy, where I was lately loafing, the perspective on our presidential race is a little different.

Although I hadn't asked him, the man announced, \"We are for Gore-Lieberman.\" I was somewhat taken aback because I have talked to so many Americans who said they didn't know enough about Gore to decide.

La pena di morte--the death penalty--the woman intoned. The phrase reverberated through my stay.\nItalians abhor capital punishment. It goes against the grain, which is that things can be worked out--an attitude that makes being in their company so delightful--and the death penalty is so arbitrary. \"Just one mistaken execution is enough argument against it,\" a reporter for La Stampa told me. He is against the death penalty but also laments the Italian obsession with it--the parliamentary delegations that fly over to plead with U.S. governors to stay executions and the extravagant sympathies that caused one Italian municipality to claim the body of an executed U.S. criminal for an honored burial.\nWhen I was in Rome, I went to the Coliseum one day to check out the fake gladiators who have sprung up in the wake of that summer movie and who hang around to have their pictures taken with tourists.

Bob Barr seems more concerned with protecting the gun industry from lawsuits than protecting consumers from guns.\nThis week, U.S. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia announced legislation that would bar local governments from filing lawsuits against gun manufacturers.\nSome of the proposed suits do seem a little far-fetched. Chicago, for example, is suing gun makers for selling too many firearms to suburban stores around the Windy City while knowing that some of those products are being bought for use in Chicago itself. That argument sounds a little strained, but the legal system is perfectly capable of making that judgment.\nOn the other hand, the approach taken by New Orleans --- questioning whether gun makers have made their products as safe as possible --- does raise interesting issues. If that approach succeeds, it might force gun makers to take safety concerns more seriously in designing and manufacturing weapons.\nRight now, no agency monitors gun safety, design or manufacture. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, for example, is specifically barred by law from regulating the safety of two widely sold products.\nOne is firearms. The other is tobacco.\nBecause of that exemption, public-health advocates had little recourse other than the courts to try to curtail the health damage done by tobacco. The success of tobacco-related lawsuits has clearly inspired New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta and other cities to adopt a similar strategy on guns. (The tobacco experience teaches another lesson as well. Private lawyers who filed those cases on behalf of states walked away with billions of dollars, which ought to serve as a warning for city officials contemplating firearm suits.)\n", ["Economic", "Political", "Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction", "Health and Safety", "Policy Prescription and Evaluation"]], ["Justices Uphold a Death Sentence Twice Overturned\nThe Supreme Court on Monday reinstated a death sentence that a California jury imposed in 1982 and that was twice overturned by the federal appeals court in San Francisco.\nRuling 5 to 4, the justices held that a disputed instruction that the appeals court found had improperly constrained the jury's discretion to consider all the defendant's mitigating evidence in fact gave the jurors adequate advice and had probably not confused them.\nThe decision was the first of the court's new term, which began on Oct. 3, the day on which this case, Ayers v. Belmontes, No. 05-493, was argued. Usually, the first decision of a term is unanimous, or nearly so, a logical result of the fact that unanimous decisions are easier to produce than those that must await a dissenting opinion.\nNo one at the court on Monday could remember a term that began with a 5-to-4 decision. But while this decision might, on the surface, suggest that the current court is on the way toward setting a record for internal division, that is not necessarily the case. A more likely explanation is that much of the majority opinion was in fact drafted last spring, before the court agreed to hear California's appeal.\nThe entry on the court's public docket shows that while the state's appeal was pending the justices discussed it nine times at closed-door conferences. With cases typically being discussed only once or twice, if at all, nine is an unusually high number.

But this tender account from filmmakers Guido Santi and Tina Mascara also includes designs for living and recipes for a more perfect union. In part, the documentary answers the question of why some couples flourish and others flounder.\nChris and Don met, in 1953, on a Santa Monica, Calif., muscle beach where older men cruised for young blood. The British, boyish-looking Isherwood (best-known as the author of the Berlin Stories that are the basis of Cabaret) was 49 and the beach-boy Bachardy, a celebrity hunter and autograph hound, scarcely 18. What developed was an asymmetrical, although not untypical, relationship between a successful man and a trophy partner.\nThe filmmakers use home movies, Isherwood's keenly observed diary entries (read by Cabaret star Michael York) and Bachardy's shimmering paintings to tell their love story. Isherwood's comic drawings of himself as an old horse and Bachardy as a kitten are animated to give the flavor of the private communication between the lovers.\nEarly on in the affair, they went to Monument Valley where John Ford was shooting a film (possibly The Searchers) and where the legendarily macho director and his crew mistook them for father and son. There was more than a touch of parent/child in their relations.

In fact, the EPA has taken a wholly reasonable path, and the judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit should affirm it.\nThe underlying problem is that the EPA is attempting to apply the Clean Air Act - a law written in the 1960s, when air pollution issues involved toxic pollutants such as particulate matter and sulfur dioxide - to the climate issue, which requires different remedies. Dealing with carbon dioxide is not as easy as installing scrubbers in smokestacks. The sources of the country's electricity must shift away from carbon-rich fuels such as coal toward cleaner ones. Citing a section of the law that allows the EPA to require the \"best system of emissions reduction\" for certain air pollutants, the agency created the Clean Power Plan, which requires states to draw up emissions-cutting strategies not plant by plant, as previous Clean Air Act rules have done, but across the whole electricity system.

By 1950, four separate retrospective studies had linked smoking to the disease.\nIn 1951, British researchers enrolled 40,000 physicians in a study that lasted more than 40 years.

Thus, greenhouse gases come directly from several sources: fossil fuel power plants generating electricity; internal combustion and turbine engines powering vehicles and machines; boilers, furnaces and other devices generating heat; and burning vegetation or organic matter.\nA building gobbles up lots of fossil fuel-based energy, both for its construction and subsequent operation. Therefore, imagine how much the industrialized world's inventory of buildings must contribute directly and indirectly to greenhouse gas emissions.\nFirst, millions of watts are consumed to provide all of the materials required to construct a building. Power is needed to extract and transport natural resources; to refine or transform them; to shape them into the final products specified by the architect; and then to deliver and install them at the construction site.\nOnce built, a building can consume billions of watts over its lifetime, energy required to heat and cool the structure, to light it, to power the machines, equipment and appliances inside it and periodically to maintain and repair it.\n", ["Capacity and Resources primany", "External Regulation and Reputation", "Capacity and Resources"]], ["Court: Texas can't stop gay divorce that's granted\nDALLAS -- The Texas attorney general can't block a divorce granted to two women who were legally married elsewhere, an appeals court ruled Friday.\nA judge in Austin granted a divorce last February to Angelique Naylor and Sabina Daly, who were married in Massachusetts in 2004 and then returned home to Texas.\nA day after the divorce was granted, Texas Attorney General Gregg Abbott filed a motion to intervene in the case, arguing the judge didn't have the jurisdiction to grant the divorce because Texas has a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.

But it has a longer-term impact too; it's another piece of evidence that the fight over gay marriage is effectively over in this country.\nPolitically speaking, this has been true for some time - a reality largely due to a massive shift in public opinion on the issue, which occurred in late 2011 and accelerated over the intervening years.

(The first time Gallup showed a majority supporting same-sex marriage was in May 2011.)\nThe trend line in the charts above is pretty clear. But even those charts undersell the steady march of public opinion toward acceptance of legalization of gay marriage. The other key factor to consider in understanding that movement is that young people are far more supportive of legalizing gay marriage than older citizens. Age is actually a more telling indicator of where you stand on gay marriage than party affiliation; more than six in ten Republicans ages 18-29 supported gay marriage in a March Pew poll as compared with just 22 percent of Republicans 65 and older.\nBut wait, there's more. For people who say that young people who are supportive of gay marriage will change their tune as they age, that is not born out in the data, either.

Here's where three key initiatives stand:\nTailpipe emissions: In a battle with national implications, California is seeking permission from the Environmental Protection Agency to enact its own regulations of vehicle emissions. The goal is to reduce those emissions by 30 percent by 2016. Twelve states are ready to join California with identical regulations. California formally sought permission from the EPA in 2005, but it wasn't until this summer that the EPA announced it would make a decision later this year. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he will sue in October if the waiver for state authority - which the state can seek under the Clean Air Act - is not granted. Meanwhile, the Department of Transportation is opposing the waiver.\nRenewable energy: California's utilities are required by law to ensure that 20 percent of their power is renewable by 2010, but they are struggling to reach that target because there is not enough energy from solar, wind, biomass and other low-carbon sources. Congress is considering a similar national renewable fuel standard, which some experts say would spur the development and use of more renewable fuels and bring down costs.\nGlobal warming: California's most far-reaching law, AB 32, sets the goal of reducing by 25 percent greenhouse gas emissions from all sources by 2020. Better energy efficiency, new regulations and market forces are supposed to do the job, but unless Congress adopts national goals for reducing emissions - not likely to happen this year - the task will be more difficult and cost more, energy experts say. Recently, Schwarzenegger was accused of political meddling after he fired the head of the California Air Resources Board, the agency charged with enforcing AB 32.

Papa mentioned how Frazier had been buried in an old small cemetery in Black Jack reserved especially for colored folk.  Frazier, a hard worker who didn't want to take a chance of losing his precious $2 a day job, faithfully brought his wages home to his wife Mattie and his children.  When Frazier's frame house mysteriously burned down, Papa helped him rebuild - this time of brick.  Frazier always wore a faded, sweat-stained corduroy hunting cap over his grey hair and carried a dollar pocket watch, that only had an hour hand. He explained it was given to him, and besides the hour hand was all he needed to tell dinner time (noon).  I asked why he never ate his sandwich with Papa's other employees. He explained they didn't want to eat with a Negro, but that was all right with him.  Being 7 years old, I tried to convince him he was imagining the discrimination. All he said was, ''God bless you, when you get older you will change.'' The last time I saw him was when I returned from World War II. His beat-up old Chevy was at the end of New Halls Ferry Road.

Doris Conrad writes in an Aug. 24 letter that a $5,000 tax credit and a $500 personal income tax deduction would be of no benefit as people unemployed couldn't afford to buy a house or earn enough for the exemption.  There are some 7.5 million unemployed, less than the 8.5 million unemployed in 1980. However, there are some 150 million employed people.  Many employed young people could purchase a first home with the $5,000 credit. Coupled with the increase of a $500 personal tax credit, their purchasing power would be increased.  With a new home comes the purchase of furniture, appliances, drapes, tools - a host of items. This stimulates demand and production of these products, which creates jobs. This, of course, puts people back to work, allowing them to buy a new home, new products, etc.  So you see, it's a cycle that, once started, benefits all.

Garrison Assistant U.S. Attorney Fairview Heights Signals Of Distress In Roger Signor's Aug. 23 article about the rise in teen suicide, he and the experts he quoted avoided two crucial questions on the subject. First, why do our precious teen-agers feel such self-hatred and lack of hope that they are increasingly attempting and sometimes succeeding at killing themselves?  Second, why do the parents of these children so often ignore the signals of distress that teens exhibit?  Parenting is no easy task in today's complex society. But people who make the choice to become parents must begin to take responsibility for the very re al needs of their children. Parents must take the initiative in helping their teens navigate the confusing waters of our culture.  Most of all, parents must pay close attention to their children: listening to, and expressing concern and empathy for their kids' difficulties. Denying children's need for active emotional support is indeed a form of abuse. I believe the temptation to minimize and trivialize the pain of children and adolescents is great. We, as a society, do not want to recognize the psychological impact of the problems we ourselves have created.  Parents do not want to accept responsibility for the failure of parenting techniques that have been passed down from generation to generation. But we must begin to try - there is so much at stake.  Lucia Miller St. Louis Ask The Lawyer?  The Aug. 12 editorial, ''For Order In The Court,'' advises voters to heed the advice soon to be published by The Missouri Bar concerning a poll of its members about incumbent judges who are up for re-election in the coming general election. Inasmuch as these lawyers are participating members of the court system, it is a little like asking the fox guarding the chicken house about the safety of the chickens. The last time I looked, the credibility of lawyers was around the level of used car salesmen and members of Congress.  The problems of the judicial system, long waiting periods before trial (sometimes years), catering to the whims of lawyers, numerous continuations, special privileges to the wealthy, mistrials and dismissal of charges because of persnickety clerical mistakes and faulty decisions have the public disgusted and mad.  It does not take a great deal of intelligence to see why the no vote has increased in the past several elections.  If in the future, as former Sen. Thomas Eagleton fears, some good judges are washed away in the cleansing, so be it. It's a small price to pay for delivering the message: Shape up or ship out.  William A.

Rod Blagojevich this month, and the Democratic governor has indicated he will sign it. The bill, as passed, would ban smoking in all indoor public places, including casino riverboats and horse-racing tracks.\nSen. James Clayborne, D-Belleville, filed two measures Wednesday that seek to alter that soon-to-be-enacted law. One of the measures would lift the ban from all gambling facilities within 10 miles of a state border; the other would specifically lift the ban from riverboats within five miles of a border.\nThe measures would keep the ban off those facilities for five years, or until the neighboring state passes its own ban. Both measures were filed as amendments to a gaming bill pending in the Senate.\nClayborne's amendments would apply to four of Illinois' nine boats: the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Argosy Casino in Alton, Jumer's Casino in Rock Island and Harrah's Casino in Metropolis.\nIt was questionable Wednesday whether the proposal has a realistic chance at passage.

But it also raises the question of how long until every state in the country will allow same-sex couples to marry, or whether some states never will without a Supreme Court ruling legalizing marriages nationally.\nFor some time, advocates of allowing same-sex couple to marry have pointed to the country's history with anti-miscegenation laws -- bans on marriage between the races --  as an example of the march of progress. A century ago, marriage between blacks and whites was still illegal in more than half of the states. With the Supreme Court's 1967 decision Loving v. Virginia, the 17 states that still had laws banning the practice found their laws invalidated. (Data below is from LovingDay.org.)\nWhat's interesting is that, in the decade prior to Loving, laws in a number of states were repealed by state legislatures or thrown out by the courts. It's hard not to see parallels in the current momentum against gay marriage bans. A decade ago, Massachusetts' Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. As of Monday, it appears that more than half of the states have legalized gay marriage.\nBut what if Loving didn't exist? What would have happened if the Court hadn't invalidated bans on interracial marriage? Anti-miscegenation laws were more deeply rooted than anti-same-sex-marriage laws, and it seems clear that the march of repeal would hit a line of opposition that had previously been demarcated by Mason and Dixon. The court's decision in Loving overturned a ban on interracial marriage in Virginia that was three centuries old, predating even the United States. No states currently have even unenforceable bans on the books -- but 20 years ago, that wasn't the case. In November 1998, South Carolina finally threw out its ban following a public referendum. But Alabama was the last state to do so -- overturning its (unenforceable) ban in 2000.\n", ["Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction", "Fairness and Equality", "Cultural Identity"]], ["EDITORIAL Scrap marriage amendment\nU.S. Rep.

Their new language is at least as ambiguous as their old wording.\nThe first sentence in both the original and newer version of the Musgrave-Allard amendment reads: 'Marriage in the United States  shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman.'\nThe original then went on to state: 'Neither this Constitution or  the constitution of any state, nor state or federal law, shall be  construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents  thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups.'\nThe new second sentence reads: 'Neither this Constitution, nor the  constitution of any state, shall be construed to require that  marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union  other than the union of a man and a woman.'\nWell, that's clear as mud.\nThe problem with both versions is defining those 'legal  incidents' of marriage that are prohibited to same-sex couples and  distinguishing them from the legal rights that could supposedly be  conveyed in a civil union.

Heller (from which Justice Stevens dissented) em-phasized that \"the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.\" He enumerated a wide range of \"presumptively lawful\" gun regulations, including bans on possession by felons and the mentally ill, dangerous and unusual weapons, and the carrying of weapons in sensitive places.\nIn more than 1,000 Second Amendment cases in the decade since Heller, courts have fleshed out those categories. They have struck down stringent (and extremely rare) laws like bans on public carry. And they have upheld the vast majority of reasonable gun laws.\nPeople sometimes say they oppose gun regulation because they support the Second Amendment, or vice versa.

SAYS CASES; WOULD SWAMP FEDERAL COURTS\nWASHINGTON - Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has taken the unusual step of asking House members to reject a Senate-passed provision that would make most handgun murders a federal crime carrying the death penalty.  Rehnquist made the rare lobbying effort against two provisions of the Senate's crime bill as the House Judiciary Committee prepared for a drafting session Monday on its version of anti-crime legislation.  The Senate bill would authorize prosecution of handgun murders as federal crimes punishable by death. The provision introduced by Sen. Alfonse M.  D'Amato, R-N.Y., would apply to all murders committed with handguns that moved across state lines.  A companion provision also sponsored by D'Amato would make it a federal crime with a 10-year prison sentence for using a handgun to commit a violent felony. The sentence would jump to 20 years if the weapon were fired.  Both provisions were adopted by lopsided Senate votes over the objections of lawmakers who said they would put further strain on the already overburdened federal courts.  Opponents also argued that Congress would be trampling on the prerogatives of states to handle most criminal prosecutions. The federal death penalty for murders committed with handguns that moved in interstate commerce could be invoked in the 14 states that do not have capital punishment.  Rehnquist acted in his role as presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a policymaking group of federal judges.  A Judicial Conference statement accompanying Rehnquist's letter said the D'Amato amendments ''will swamp the federal courts with routine cases that states are better equipped to handle, and will weaken the ability of the federal courts effectively to deal with difficult criminal cases that present uniquely federal issues.'' The expanded federal jurisdiction ''would be inconsistent with long-accepted concepts of federalism, and would ignore the boundaries between appropriate state and federal action.'' ''Not only will bona fide federal criminal prosecutions suffer if the Senate's expansive firearms provisions are adopted, but federal courts, overburdened by criminal cases, will be unable to carry out their vital responsibilities to provide timely forums for civil cases.'' The Judicial Conference expressed its opposition when the Senate passed the crime bill in July.  Rehnquist's cover letter said he wanted to convey the conference's opposition ''to proposed legislation that would provide federal jurisdiction over offenses traditionally reserved for state prosecution.'' A study of the potential impact of the provisions was prepared by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. The study estimated that it would cost between $31 million and $2.7 billion a year to prosecute people who commit murders with handguns that have moved across state lines.  There are nearly 12,000 handgun murders each year nationwide, and 95 percent of them involve guns that moved across state lines, the study said.  The study also estimated that it could cost between $54.6 million to $1 billion to prosecute criminals for using handguns to commit other felonies.  There are nearly 136,000 such crimes committed each year, the study said.  D'Amato has defended his approach as a necessary antidote to the increased rate of gun-related crime. He said the Judicial Conference's statement was an ''institutional response which completely misses the problem.'' ''Federal judges feel they're overworked now, and in fact they may be, but the first duty of government should be to protect the people,'' he said.  He added that he would support legislation to provide resources to help federal courts handle any additional workload cr eated by his legislation.

There is no reason to believe the children of illegal immigrants are any different.\nCongress should think long and hard before tampering with this essential American principle embodied in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.

Taney declared that no black person, free or slave, could be a citizen of the United States.\nThe Civil War transformed the debate over citizenship.

It begins by defining as citizens all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" -- language meant to exclude Indians, deemed to be citizens of their respective tribes, and American-born children of foreign diplomats.

The case that breathed life into the Second Amendment was District of Columbia v Heller.\nI attended law school nearly 40 years ago and cannot remember any mention of the Second Amendment back then, though today it is among the most discussed, debated, supported, and hated of the amendments. The Heller decision turned on the amendment's history and meaning to its authors and their contemporaries rather than on the wishful thinking of those who have since tried to ignore both in the policy debates over firearms laws and rights.\nA reading of the Second Amendment is important as it does not represent a government grant of anyone's right to \"keep and bear arms,\" but instead prohibits the new government from \"infringing\" on that right. This is an implicit recognition that the right predated the formation of the new Republic and the drafting of the Second Amendment itself. It was instead the recognition of what the founders believed to be the natural right to defend oneself, one's family, community and nation; a right recognized much earlier in the English Bill of Rights and by many of the American colonies long before the break with Great Britain.\n", ["Legality, Constitutionality, Jurisdiction"]], ["Breathing lessons\nResearchers envision those at risk one day popping a daily tablet to thwart the deadly disease.

The case should be remanded for fact-finding in the district court, to see if plaintiff is correct about the effect of the zoning regulations. 2.

Mason is a St. Louis homebuilder who also is chairman of Germania Bank, which was seized in June by the Office of Thrift Supervision as one of the many failed savings and loan associations in the nation.

The accusation was made by Keith Templeton. Templeton will be listed along with fellow Webster Groves residents Emmy McClelland, the ex-Blunt aide, and Brian A. McLain on the 97th District Republican primary ballot Aug. 7. Templeton said he tried to withdraw May 28 because he fears that he and McLain would split the anti-abortion vote and that McClelland, an abortion rights supporter, would benefit. He said he had been unaware of any deadline. Templeton alleged that Blunt in a 1988 court case had not opposed a similar post-deadline withdrawal of Roy Cagle, a congressional candidate from Joplin. In that case, the judge allowed Cagle's withdrawal. This year, a judge did the opposite and rejected McLain's lawsuit to force Blunt to remove Templeton. Blunt's office denied the accusation of favoritism and said it had, in fact, opposed both post-deadline withdrawals. Aides released a copy of a legal brief that they said was filed in the 1988 case showing Blunt's opposition then.  Paul Bloch, deputy secretary of state, acknowledged that the office opposed Templeton's withdrawal this year ''more strongly'' because of concern that such requests would ''snowball'' in the future and hinder local election officials facing ballot printing deadlines.

It is true that when we've talked about the civil rights movement during the past 40 years, we were referring to the movement to provide rights for African-Americans. But there have been many other civil rights movements, for example, equal rights for women and the fight against discrimination of other minorities.\nTo demonstrate the difference between the homosexual rights movement and the African-American movement, Ms. Parker says that \"African-Americans were defending themselves against state-approved abuse, including murder, and trying to establish their equal dignity as person(s) . . . \" What does Ms. Parker think that homosexuals are trying to do? If she took time to inform herself about the homosexual movement, she would know that only last year did the Supreme Court strike down sodomy laws in the United States, laws which were kept intact in most states mainly to target, persecute and demoralize homosexuals across the nation.\nIndeed, in 2004, homosexuals still are very much under attack physically, psychologically and legally (by the state). Just as with any American, homosexuals only want to pursue happiness with the same rights everybody else has.
